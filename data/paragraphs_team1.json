And as usual, I'll provide an overview of our fiscal third quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2014. Afterwards, both Brad and I will be pleased to answer questions from analysts and institutional investors. A reminder that our remarks and responses during today's call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties related to the financial and operating results of Canaccord Genuity Group. The company's actual results may differ materially from management's expectations for various reasons that are outlined in our cautionary statement and in the discussion of risks in our MD&A and supplementary financial information, all of which were made available yesterday evening. These documents can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Our third quarter results were impacted by ongoing economic and political uncertainty in many of the regions where we operate, which led to a postponement of transaction activity in many of our core markets. Against a challenging backdrop, we have maintained a disciplined focus on safeguarding our ability to deliver the depth and quality of service our global clients have come to expect while taking steps to align the structure of our business to operate efficiently and effectively in a market that continues to evolve."

Now regarding insurance and more generally I think we have to move - we’ll have a clear view of the origination distribution model under Basel 3 and this is a fundamental challenge for Europe. Basel 3 means that the banks I believe will continue to originate credit and will often hold them for a significant period of time, especially if you look at project financing perhaps during the build phase when cash flows aren’t certain, when there are construction related risks on the projects, where the risk is a function of our assessment of the country, the technology, the project, the sponsor, et cetera. And then where we distributed more in the way of the loans especially when the cash flow is coming in to investors who are obviously interested in an area, in a period when yields going to remain low across a larger range of assets and when liquidity is high."

This represents a $45 million year-over-year headwind. Through 2019, we work to mitigate the impact of tariffs by sourcing product from other geographies, by asking our suppliers to share the cost burden and by selectively increasing prices where possible. We will continue to work on mitigating the impact of tariffs over time. We will be fully lapping the full year-over-year impact of tariffs as we move into the second half of 2020."

Second, from a production standpoint, maybe you could quantify the effects of the pipeline interruptions in terms of how much that affected the quarter and just have a little bit better idea on how much effect that had.

So in terms of your strategy for the subsidiary, I mean, if you remain committed with Turkey, could you consider buying out the minorities at this level? Because I mean, obviously, if you are comfortable with revenue prospects and cost of risk resiliency, this target is probably at a -- [ achieved to know valuation ]. Obviously, the macro uncertainty is high, but the opportunity for you over the long term could be there. So I would like to understand your view there. And the second one, on the CPI linkers. Could you elaborate on the long-term risk to roll those linkers? I mean, is there any chance that it could affect fiscal deficit in the country and the government would be forced to stop issuing this type of debt?

The U.S. drives our effective tax rate -- effective tax rate in U.S. is just over 30%. The challenge is, is if losses generated in other entities drives the consolidated effective tax rate obviously up a lot higher, because it infringes on the profitability of the U.S. operations. So if you look into '19, what I can tell you is what I would expect the cash tax rate to be -- is at a very small, like less than 5%. The effective tax rate is a little more complicated than that, and I don't want to go into the details of the math. So I would say that you would probably peg the effective tax rate 30% to 50%, but a very small component of that is actual cash taxes, because of utilization of NOLs and R&D tax credits and all the rest that we have available to us."

Most companies I know of, or all companies I know of, still have a corporate network and still have data centers that they need to defend. On top of that, there are virtualized servers that can be protected, because they want to use public cloud services, but that still can and needs to be secured. And we have several products in the virtualization area and in the private and public clouds. And you were speaking about Software-as-a-Service kind of services like Gmail and salesforce.com and others. These are more difficult to secure, but there are still some technologies that can be used. They are more difficult to secure because, by definition, you use a shared infrastructure and use an application that's shared amongst multiple companies. But even in there, there are few ideas about securing that. And by the way, some of that around mobility and data security, these are definitely areas we're working on and this is an area that will show some nice innovation during the rest of the year. So this is clearly an area that we are working on. Overall, I haven't seen any company that sort of moved from securing their data centers or their infrastructure, quite the contrary. I mean, the cyber security risks are getting higher than companies -- as much as they leveraged some Software-as-a-Service cloud services, they are still having a pretty -- and in the enterprise space, they still have very serious data centers and corporate offices that they need to defend."

However, our continued focus on cost resulted in a $6 million increase in EBIT compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And the inventory reduction helped us deliver strong quarterly free cash flow of $386 million. Earnings per share of $0.31 was below $0.33 in the fourth quarter of last year. The benefit of improved profitability in South America driven by product support growth was offset by the negative impact from the social unrest in Chile of about $0.05, $10 million of higher finance cost as well as higher long-term incentive plan cost due to an increase in our share price."

So the backlog -- there was some drop in backlog in Virginia, and I would say that is natural because there are two large companies there who have a much larger average project size.

So some of those sites will have preference, from our perspective, because they already sort of see the benefits of INTERCEPT and pathogen inactivation and there is strong interest in having a complete solution for all 3 components. Another factor that influences the demand on their end is a lot of these blood centers would like to get rid of their cesium source irradiators so that they can deal with some of the non-proliferation legislation that's coming out of the EU, I guess, policy.

This is now the direct business in Russia than in the previous 3 years. That certainly has to do with very much stronger penetration now of our new Russian management team, compensating for all the other [indiscernible]. You're absolutely right, Peter, that the indirect impact on the neighboring countries such as Poland or other Eastern European countries, which used to export not only dairy but many other things plus those countries used to export cheese products like you just named some of them, that is very complex to understand and there will be a counter effect because some countries, which are not following the embargoes, like Argentina, like China, et cetera, they're lining up to try to compensate for that. But as I just mentioned 10 minutes ago, it will take time until they are up to compensate for what cannot be exported from Holland or Germany or France, et cetera. In a nutshell, I think it's too complex to really have a single equation on what is the impact on this Russian thing."

After several challenging quarters for the Agency MBS and rate markets, those headwinds faded and some even turn to tailwinds during the fourth quarter. A return to more normalized funding markets and a third Federal reserve rate cut helped boost net interest margins for levered investors such as ourselves. The modest rise in longer-term rates, the resulting steeper yield curve and declining implied volatility further helped create an environment where Agency MBS valuations could tighten along with other spread product. Our core earnings in the quarter were $0.52 per share, including a $0.02 retrospective adjustment. After accounting for a onetime positive $0.05 impact due to a discounted security paying off earlier than expected, our run rate core came in at $0.45, covering our current dividend."

And I certainly think, as we move through the opportunities around RYANODEX, the likelihood of ultimately winding up in the civilian stockpile will continue to increase. And then certainly, once we put the product into an IM version, then we have -- if it hasn't happened by then, we have an excellent opportunity of being able to have a full dissemination of RYANODEX available to the population if, unfortunately, it's needed.

So that's why you have seen some lowest volume growth in the country. In the other countries, you will see the impact of the capacity increases on the -- the effect on the top line. But again, unfortunately, especially in Central Asia, in Kazakhstan, we've been growing -- we're cycling about 18% in growth in 2015. If the devaluations would not have happened, we would have seen, again, healthy high-teen volume growth. But the current macro realities are suppressing the volume growth numbers in Kazakhstan. But Tajikistan, as I said, the volume growth is about 46% in Tajikistan, mainly because of the capacity. We didn't have enough products to sell in Tajikistan.

Are you going out and you're seeing whether you've got the chance to refinance in local currency at least a portion? Or are things pretty much on hold while the discussions with VEON are ongoing? Obviously, I'm noting their support separately as a context of this as well. And my second question relates to dividends from Pakistan. So you've talked in previous calls about this topic, and at the VEON presentation this morning, I think a comment by -- from the CFO about withholding tax, and that there was some expectation of dividends coming from Pakistan. So just wondered if you can give a kind of update in terms of the status there, the outlook. Are you expecting dividends or some dividends as usual from the country to be possible in 2019? That would be great."

First, as mentioned, when we gave guidance at the end of Q3, the unrest in Chile had an estimated negative impact on operating income of about $110 million. We weren't able to quantify this when we gave guidance at the end of Q3 so nothing was included. We experienced significant disruptions in nearly 3/4 of the stores at one point, with some of them completely destroyed. And now given the extent of the disruption, we don't expect the business to fully recover this year, which has been considered in our guidance today. In addition, we also recorded an unexpected legal accrual in the U.S. of approximately $75 million."

And as we sort of cascaded through the balance -- or the half second of the year, we started to see some uptick in commercial aftermarket. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice trend in commercial aftermarket. I would pause a little bit in that our fourth quarter was exceptional, and I'd be careful about creating a run rate off of our Q4 performance. But overall, we would continue to see the commercial OEM side continue to grow at a nice rate, with some incremental growth as well coming from aftermarket. On the defense side, we're going to continue to see headwinds here from our point of view. Now we had a notable headwind in 2013, if you recall, from the C-130 MNU program. So that was in our Aerospace Group, where we had a massive $10 million – well, massive. We had a $10 million project that we satisfied largely last year, and we had that headwind this year. But to just broadly characterize, continued, I think, trends in commercial OEM, a little bit of step-up in aftermarket and continued, I would call it, modest headwinds in military."

But in the rest of the world, energy inputs, transportation costs, chemicals that come off of energy -- chemicals that come off of oil-related feedstocks, we're seeing inflation in those categories similar to what we saw last year and we're seeing labor cost inflation. Now that's a little bit of a drag on our performance this year, but I think it's a bit of a good news, bad news story because the places where we're seeing the most labor cost inflation are developing countries like China and India -- that also tends to be where we're seeing the fiercest competition on an export basis into places like Europe and the United States. So given that we have a low-cost asset base sited in Europe and the United States, where in particular in the United States, we see more muted inflation and in Europe, we're improving our cost position, having some inflation in developing countries will put pressure on exporters that are coming into markets where we think we're well-positioned with low-cost assets."

And obviously, there's been, at least, on a top down view, a lot more interest in grid hardening and transmission and distribution investment. Now I know you don't do grid, you're a distribution -- excuse me, you're in transmission, transformers, more of that in terms of the spend in testing.

For example, Bulgaria prices have gone very low, and it could have upside potential from where they are right now rather than downside potential.

On the quarter, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 1,397%, while our cash tax rate was 251%. We've recorded a larger year-to-date income tax expense for several reasons. First, we have several loss-generating entities in foreign countries where we are unable to recognize a current income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of future profits in those countries. The second reason is the treatment of stock compensation charges under GAAP, FAS 123R. For GAAP accounting, we used the fair value at the time of stock grant to determine stock compensation deductions, whereas for cash tax, we use the fair value at that time of investing. This caused the GAAP effective rate to be well above our cash rate and normal experience. This booked tax stock compensation difference will continue to occur throughout 2013 based on our current stock price. We can't predict the tax impact of stock compensation effect because of the dependency on future stock price performance. This makes our quarterly effective tax rates during 2013 difficult to predict but we would expect our cash tax rate to be similarly smaller because of our currently available net operating losses."

And because we provide security software, cybersecurity software, because we provide crisis management software and mobile, that helps facilitate the remote working from home. And what we have seen in the first 3 months or the 3 months that was the most severely impacted, what we have seen is new customers are extremely hard to come by. Existing customers, upselling to them, and they have a build-in requirement to need more software, more seats, more licenses. And in some cases, AtHoc where people are on the fence and say, well, I don't really know I need it, whatever, they have decided they need it. And so there -- and because, unfortunately, because of the crisis, it's kind of like the only silver lining to this pandemic situation. So -- but I traded notes with other CEO of other tech companies and pretty much everybody is saying the same thing, upselling and especially if you have the right type of software, it's a good expansion. It's okay to sell them remote. This is where the relationships are very important. And we fortunately -- BlackBerry has a lot of good relationship, especially in the regulated industry, like the banks and the medical field and the government. So that help us to put some kind of anchor into the business. The new project, the new customer base, I would have to say, it's much more difficult to come by."

I think when you look at -- when we heard John's comment, when he was walking you through, and it's reflected on Page 4 in the supplemental deck, the $175 million was just kind of the midpoint of the guidance today to the $167 million, is really those 3 buckets that we talked about, AFX, $3 million. And we have said at the beginning of the year that the range $170 million to $180 million was predicated on how well the U.S. does when it came to AFX. And the rest of it was OUS. But then you look at it on the chart, Latin America weakness was $3 million, which I mentioned primarily was driven by Brazil and Argentina and the softness in the business there, currency and some political pressures. The regulatory delays were OUS in our Asia-Pac markets, where we were expecting some product approvals that haven't come in yet. So that's really what's driving us to the operational low end of the range from $170 million to $167 million. Now the $167 million to the $145 million and $155 million is really what we are talking about as kind of second half reset drivers."

In the case of our Mexican operation, it's lower than that, and we calculate this around 25%. And with the devaluation in Mexico, this will have its positive effect on the total cost of the company. In the case of Argentina, today, what we're seeing differently from what we saw at the beginning of last year is the reduced level of devaluation that with the current inflation in the current -- in the country probably will, in fact, have a negative impact in the cost structure. But as you know, we need to -- we do follow this very closely.

Then legacy MAS inflation accounted for 0.9 points of headwind, and mix in the CSS business, within the CSS business, and legacy MAS accounted for minus 0.7 point effect. That was roughly split equally between the RMR and install mix effect within CSS and weaker retrofit sales versus new construction in the legacy MAS business. Now all of that totals about 5.4 points of headwind, which was a pretty dramatic headwind within the quarter in the Security segment, but it was partially offset by a really strong performance in synergies and productivity, which provided a 3.0-point benefit.

In Latin America, we're just continuing to see what I've been talking about it on almost every call, which is very careful decision-making. No -- generally, no particular urgency, and we push our customers hard. We give them incentives to close business in the quarter. And while we're not losing these deals, they're just taking longer to get done. I would add to that, that every deal needs multiple layers of approval.

Commercial Aerospace demand continues to be strong, as evidenced by production rates and order backlogs at Boeing and Airbus, reflecting the need for a more fuel-efficient aircraft. Although passenger miles continue to increase at healthy rates, which should result in growing aftermarket business. Commercial aftermarket sales have been relatively flat this year but were up in the quarter compared to a weak comparable in the same quarter of 2012. The market for large business jets continues to show signs of growth while smaller business jets remain depressed. Regional jets remain soft but order books have started to fill in. Rotorcraft remains a solid growth driver within our Aerospace business. Commercial rotorcraft experienced strong build rates on new and existing platforms while military rotorcraft sales were also strong in this quarter. Despite government budget uncertainty, including sequestration, military aftermarket remains solid, sequentially and compared to the prior year, while military OEM is showing signs of softness. The integration of our Duarte business is on track both operationally and financially. Performance metrics are improving and technology integration has already begun. The acquisition continues to enhance our relationships with major OEMs."

So the sales and revenues increase is up just 3%. It's not a significant increase versus 2016. And so while we certainly are pleased and excited that we're able to raise the outlook this morning, it's not a significant raise versus last year. So we still are remaining cautious. Certainly, still many, many of our end markets are at very depressed levels. I think from a perspective of what we need to see to -- one, I would say, as you mentioned, and it's in the release, what gave us the confidence to raise the outlook was a very strong quarter, very strong order rate and an increase in the backlog that should be fairly sustainable. What we continue to keep an eye on is business optimism in North America and do we continue to see order rates stay at higher levels than we incurred in 2016. We do want to watch the volatility of oil and other commodity prices. And there's still tremendous geopolitical uncertainty around the world that we're keeping our eye on and want to make sure I think before we would take another step that we're comfortable about sustainability of the order rates versus what we saw in the first quarter."

South America is still kind of those mid-80s range. And as I mentioned last call, a lot of it is going into the noncyclical industries, so fairly resilient merchant supply there. Europe is low, mid-70s. We are, as I mentioned, starting to see some uptick. So while the energy business is quite down, the base underlying in manufacturing is picking up, and we're especially seeing that more in the packaged side of the business. And Asia, it's a little bit different depending upon the country. On balance, we're probably mid-70s, but Korea's still quite high. India is low, but that's just due to some capacity that started up. We're loading that capacity as we speak. And then China's a little low just given partly the overcapacity and partly our concerted effort to transition from distributor sales to direct sales.

In terms of the fee and commission business, we have a strong quarter.

The impact on that matter is translated in slightly lower entry fees. So we saw in this respect about EUR 900 million of sales but that was not fully compensating the investments which were coming to maturity. So we had a slight net outflow, a bit lower than EUR 200 million for the whole book.

But our portfolio is somewhat unique when you -- when it's made up of things like terrorism, war risk and offshore oil rigs, you still need events to have an attritional loss ratio. And so I think that defines why we're not seeing any upticks in Talbot's attritional. And Validus' attritional loss ratio is very, very static over -- frankly, over the entirety of the cycle at this point. And so there's different conditions in each one of our markets. When you aggregate all of them, I think the influence of the Validus attritional loss ratio, being our largest business, is a big moderator, combined with the Talbot kind of attrition being event related.

Annual zinc production is projected to increase materially to 51,500 wet metric tons. As we have discussed previously, there are several zinc mines and, in particular, a very large one in Australia that are scheduled to cease operations in the coming months. And market wisdom says that this dynamic would drive the increase in the price of zinc over the next few years. We are projecting annual copper production of 34,000 wet metric tons this year. Copper prices hinge on the Chinese economy, but are expected to be stronger towards the latter half of the year and, actually, have risen from their low point previously on this year. Everyone is probably wondering about security with the events in Yemen unfolding relatively close to the area of the mining operation. Extra security is being provided by the government, AMAK has explosives and a cyanide on site and ships its product out of the Red Sea border Jizan and the southwestern tip of Saudi Arabia.

As it relates to timing, that's the big uncertainty. We're conservatively factoring that into our forecast but that's probably most of it in 2018. As I mentioned, we did have the Nevada National Security Site, which was a small component of that $600 million that we just recently won in now the fourth quarter and so that will convert in the fourth quarter to our backlog.

And after a number of years where we had very modest salary pressure, we're starting to see a little bit more salary pressure in some geographies. So that adds both to the revenue and to the margin, but it also adds to the G&A. So I think that when you look at the operating margins, what we've said is that through the first part of this year, we're probably going to be fairly steady around where we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Then as we move into '13 and see that construction start picking up a little bit, you'll see a little bit of downward pressure because of the mix, but you'll still see growth on the professional services side. And certainly you'll see growth on the total revenues side from the construction. So probably all in all, we'll see some fairly steady margins as we go forward over the next 12 months and beyond."

As Dominic noted, the degree of uncertainty around the pace of global economic recovery and geopolitical stability has increased steadily through the first half of 2011. While we remain cautious around market demand levels over the near term, we believe our overall economic assumptions for 2011 are still sound. Consequently, we're holding the upper end of our EPS guidance range flat at $3.35 per share, and given the strength of our results through the first half, raising the lower end of our guidance to $3.20 per share on an operating basis."

In addition, we face continuing volatility in copper prices, as well as inflationary pressures across our business. It can be challenging to keep all these in perspective. Nonetheless, the fact is that we have had a very strong first 6 months in 2011 and have executed quite well. Further, moving into the second half of 2011, we anticipate continued demand stability within both our OEM and distribution segments, which should be aided by both the seasonal uptick we generally experience in the back half of the year, as well as from incremental business brought about by our recent acquisitions."

So -- not on the other trades, but on the other routes from Asia to Europe. So in total, we're trying to balance that. We usually are pricing a bit above the competition. And we at the moment, when we look at the rate picture, we continue to be pricing a bit above the competition. During the rate war, of course, we went down same thing as – or to the same rates -- not to the same, but in parallel with the competition. And we probably feel that the improved service from daily Mærsk plus the fact that we were -- that we didn't increase the rate differential was probably one of the reasons why the rate war became so heavy and also why we took market share. This year, we're still maintaining Mærsk Line at more or less market rate levels. That means a bit above the competition, but we don't have a premium of any significance compared to the other trades that we operate. Maybe this will change in the future.

And so the nature of the assets, the nature of the activities that are conducted are more important than the -- well, at least as important as the macroeconomic figures. And to that respect, again, we insist on the fact that our business model is very diversified with a certain number of important businesses which have very low cost of risk. For example, security services, that's almost 0 cost of risk. We have the private banking, which is one of our strong points as a very low or nil cost of risk.

But given the political and potential regulatory changes, lessening of regulatory scrutiny on the cable sector in the U.S. and all the talks about potential M&As in the U.S., I really think that -- or it appears that the conditions have become more difficult if you want to be a buyer, just given the valuations and how -- where they're going. So I guess I'm trying to reconcile what we're seeing and hearing from all the other peers versus what you're seeing on that front. And then the second related question is also in the U.S., perhaps a question for Patrice. Can you just remind us of your current cash tax situation in the U.S. given the potential changes that -- with respect to tax reform in the U.S.? I'm not asking for any outlook with respect to the U.S. change, but just can you give us the current situation, how much cash taxes you're paying in the U.S. and what the rate is just so that we can understand what the current status quo is?"

So we see those as being able to not only fund the devex program that we've talked about, but at the same time, at the margin, there will be opportunities to redeploy some of that capital into medium density initiatives, and there'll be some capacity at the margin to redeploy some of that towards some of the other sector exposures. But we're not talking about, here, moving to a wholesale, massive reduction or shift. I mean, clearly, we'd have to have very different target range of asset exposure if that was implied. So these are things that are at the margin, and we stress also organic and will be done within our capability to execute. There's no silver bullet here.

We believe that this area will develop quite dramatically over the next couple of years. And also if you ranked the existing online stores, OZON will be much, much higher with the huge distance from anybody else who would try to enter that market or who would be there competing. Therefore, we believe that OZON will be definitely the best match if we wanted to first invest into that area, and second, get hold of it and develop together.

But no, we should have decent leverage, I mean, our whole philosophy is about driving operating margins up in the fee business, take out the underneath for a second, because they're made a little bit differently.

That short-term cash management, which I explained, has a difference of EUR 8 million. The profit of those short-term cash management actions are allocated, taking into account reference interest rates, which are intrinsically market interest rates. Now because of the movements of that reference rate, the allocation between Czech Republic and the business unit Group Centre is different between quarter 1 and quarter 2. Now the shift is negative in the second quarter and that shift is exactly the difference in the net interest income, which was generated in the Czech Republic and therefore explains the full difference, almost the full difference between quarter 1 and quarter 2 in Czech Republic.

More importantly, the way we think about sort of our growth trajectory in relation to getting to our profitability, as Charles mentioned, for us, it's very, very important to continue to invest in customer acquisition, continue to invest in promotions around sort of the tea launch, because we do not want to forfeit growth at the cost of the profitability.

As I noted in my summary comments, the shortfall versus our recent expectations came primarily from Africa, Asia and select noncore businesses. More specifically, in Africa, as Namal mentioned, changing CD4 guidelines as well as delayed tenders and price competition in the malaria market hurt third quarter sales. We do expect fourth quarter to be a much stronger number in Africa, with CD4 and malaria products bouncing back a bit and sales of HIV products filling the rest of the gap. With respect Asia, the shortfall in China was driven by economic volatility, which caused some distributor destocking. Korea had the hangover effect of the MERS outbreak, which dampened overall utilization in that country. Notwithstanding those issues, we expect Q4 to be a much better overall number in Asia, with China, Japan and India leading the way. And finally, looking at our noncore or other revenue, the shortfall was primarily due to sales in our consumer JV, which carried very low margin, and BBI revenue declines. As you know, this business is scheduled to be divested later this quarter."

And they did this because of the concern that this age group, as they enter college and military, will need a booster dose to have full protection. So I think this recognizes the severity of the disease. This is the first step in the process. It now goes to CDC for approval. It will then be published in what's called the MMWR [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report], which is a notice to the healthcare providers. And then, we'll go into the DFC program. So I think what we're going to see is that there'll be an expanded market place in the U.S., and we'll start to see some of the benefits of that in the first half of 2011.

So you can see that in -- when you look at the Coface momentum. In those countries, either a very high growth potential, much higher than in more mature countries like Western European countries or North America. And in those emerging countries, the rate of penetration for credit insurance is quite low, so I think that the potential growth is twice as high as in our countries.

These negatives were to some extent offset by the improved operating performance in E&P where operating profits were up 4.3% year-on-year, reflecting higher oil prices and the effort made to recover Libyan production after the suspension of much of our activity in the country during the crisis."

However, debt problems of the developed world's countries and specifically, European financial crisis in the second half of the year were the key reasons of the severe downturn in the steel sector relating to a massive inventory reduction in the steel industry, followed by falling sales volumes and then steel prices both in Europe and globally.

And I think there's many other aspects to this transaction that I think are interesting.

We began experiencing weakness in our sales volume towards the end of March due to the onset of lockdown restrictions and the vast uncertainty that permeated the country at that time. But as we noted in our earnings call in May, we were pleasantly surprised to see our sales volumes start to improve in late April. As we progressed into May and June, sales volume continued to improve across our business, with the housing industry staging a remarkable reversal from earlier predictions and indicators, while the repair and remodeling markets also contributed to what became an overall good market demand environment."

If you mean younger, that's they're not on Medicare, the majority of our patients are private pay and so it could be affected by that. However, as I traveled around the country over the last quarter with an additional concern about economic impact, I think we are seeing some patients actually more concerned about having a procedure that takes them out of their job for a long period of time during a period of uncertainty. I don't know if they feel if they're out of mind, out of sight, they could be out of a job but that is their concern. So conversely, those patients, if they could have an MIS procedure and get back to work, get treated quickly, respond and recover quickly, I think that's a benefit as opposed to more conventional surgery that could take them out of a job for half a year or so."

There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions.

Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of health care. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients but also politicians in this election year. A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices.

The shale revolution dramatically increased the supply and lowered the price of natural gas. The recession literally crushed power demand and the recovery since has been sluggish at best for much of the country. With the lower and less volatile fuel prices and little [indiscernible] the last several years, with the exception of maybe Texas in the summer of 2011, have been less than thrilling from a  power producers perspective. This one, of course, we've seen increased volatility and a significant rise in forward pricing in some markets. We believe this is not an anomaly, but rather an indication that we're in the verge of a fundamental wholesale power market recovery. Yes, much of the recent volatility has been weather-related. That said, all of our core markets are becoming structurally more volatile, as you can see on the slide.

So have a year-over-year impact adverse bringing incentive combat to sort of targeted levels.

The demand for this program remains strong, both with our customers' business with the U.S. Army and also for foreign military sales. Other key military product orders received during the quarter for products going into system were long-range surveillance and current and next-generation laser designation systems for both U.S.-based and foreign military platforms. These products enable improved target identification and tracking with portable systems for ground troops and on Humvees and other mobile platforms. Although our bookings for these programs contributed to our third quarter performance, we have experienced a delay in several other military programs as government budget constraints and the uncertainty of funding levels are rationalized."

The movement from custody FX to its other forms, our pricing is in the service we have, daily electronic servicing tied to an index. That movement has ground away for years, it's accelerated a bit over the course of the last year or so. Middle innings, late middle innings, yes. So it's -- some of it is work-through. I think I would say an additional way to look at it, the way we're looking at it, is there's some inevitability to these trading businesses as they go electronic. And for us, the objective is to retain the volume, to move it to platforms that fit customer needs. And by the way, some customers believe that custody FX is the right fit for them. And in addition, if you look at the foreign exchange franchise that we have here, there's a fair amount of noncustody business. So we've demonstrated that we can grow that business independent of the custody franchise. And we view this as an opportunity to gain share. So we think we've gained share. We know we have the widest variety of options to trade foreign exchange, at least among the trust bank universe. And so what we're doing is trying to gain more volume through more options to offset the natural compression spread that occurs from a voice-traded security to a electronic-traded security.

Then you've seen recent legislation and changes in a number of countries. Mexico, for instance, has introduced the new royalty. What impact will that make upon new exploration? So I'm not sure yet, but we are seeing -- in fact, we had 2 clients tell us specifically they canceled programs until they better understood the impact of that new legislation.

This is mainly because in Corporate, we have a lot of dollar loans outstanding. And in Retail, we had practically only ruble loans. The other reason was the reason Martin Grüll already mentioned before that a lot of Corporates utilize their credit lines in order to secure the liquidity situation of their company. So of course, our Raiffeisen Bank in Russia will be affected by the development of the currencies. But we will see how the things are going to develop, whether there will be a further devaluation of the ruble or not. What I meant is that due to the political situation and the impossible new sanctions and the uncertainty about the future development, we would not like to allocate more capital for the time being to our bank in Russia.

That causes a greater reliance on software, and that's where you saw us pick up quite a bit of revenue per transaction because they're adopting more services. They're also very worried about retention, and with the competitive environment being so price-driven, they're looking for differentiation. And that's where we think these investments we've made in the past by bringing all these GEN Y type services, which you'll see at the Investor Day, that we've been rolling out, are taking a very positive review to -- for the clients.

You may recall Kinetic, or K-BOS, has invented the device which merges next-generation materials used in the space programs with military technology to address blowout prevention. Essentially, it acts as an airbag for the drilling operation. They have just completed the test on the drilling and coil BOPs, which have significant consequence on how our customers can safely conduct their operations.  As you know, blowout like deepwater horizon have significant negative environmental impacts. And this device pretty much eliminates that possibility, and we are taking the lead in implementing it in the region. We have now a set on the ground, which is shortly going to be qualified and tested. So a great success is in the making."

Virtually all of these countries are suffering from a lack of demand, and there's economic and political uncertainty out there everywhere. As we said, these 3 facts are really highly correlated.

Then your second question, basically on how regulators will react going forward as to whether they will be more lenient to transfer of liquidity or funds, it remains to be seen, to be quite honest. Clearly, we are happy for European supervision to take over. I think it kind of will enforce a level playing field across the whole banking system in Europe and the eurozone. And then hopefully, we will all build up quite quickly a credibility to cross the borders so that local regulators will be more open to transfer of liquidity. It's certainly something we hope for, as we have indicated in our strategy launch that we -- that our plan does not depend on that because our plan basically shows the direction where we use the excess liabilities as much as possible in the -- in these countries.

If you talk to our chief economist, he would say, we're really in kind of a year-to-year type of mode right now. And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better-than-average weather where yields are above trend yields, then certainly, it's going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve, really, anywhere in -- around the globe. But if you look back at what would the implications be of trend yields or a little less-than-ideal weather or average weather and you see below-trend yields, then that story changes pretty dramatically, because we would argue that you're not -- while you certainly have ample supply of commodities and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a glut of commodities either. And so if you underproduce demand going into -- through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices would be very responsive to that, and as cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well.

And in terms of the mid-market, there's a much greater appetite for narrow networks and for focused networks in certain geographies. So the net effect of it is that those markets in our view allow product innovation. When you look at a large group full network products, you're really in a commodity product. And there's really not the ability to get competitive advantage. So I'd say, again, small group mid-market, rational but competitive; large group, kind of erratic."

So I think the single most positive learning for me was how much opportunity we had within a business that we already participate in, which, as you know, reduces a lot of risk of execution. In terms of work to be done within the core business, we have a lot of operations that are distributed across the country. Those operations have still some variability in their performance that results in inefficiency, it results occasionally in gaps in the service that we provide to our customer. So a significant area of focus for me since joining the company has been to drive out the operational variability within the company to make sure we're delivering world-class service. That's critical to me because I believe in the business model of happy customers want to buy more from you. So my goal is to provide world-class service because we want to sell to those customers."

With half the year completed, I feel very good about our performance and we're on plan financially and operationally to deliver the results we've forecasted for the full year, despite some of the macro economic challenges that exist. On that point, while nearly all businesses may be exposed to some effects of the economic downturn or have exposure to some of the proposed health care reform bills Congress is considering, we feel that Orthofix may be in a very good position to weather many of these potential storms. Our businesses have diverse geographic, product, end-user and payer mixes, which may approve to be a hedge against any single or even several macro economic challenges. As we discussed in our 10-K, our paramix [ph] (1:01:07) alone is dispersed within the United States hospitals, independent distributors, third-party insurance providers, international public health care systems, U.S. government provided insurance and self payers. While we can't predict the future, we do feel confident that the recent momentum of the past few quarters is indicative of the positive momentum and stability of our business. With that, thank you very much for joining us today on the call. We look forward to talk with you again in a few months. Thanks, operator."

That's one thing happening in the United States. The second thing that's happened in the United States is this massive 5G rollout, T-Mobile is changing the world, and you got people like Verizon and AT&T responding to that, which means they're shifting dollars and spend into 5G infrastructure rolls out. So that can have an impact on optical, right? If you're -- you might do less optical core investment dollars, you still invest in optical and packet and let's say, backhauling what you from mid hauling and front hauling, but it is less dollars probably spent relatively to the total dollar spend, when you start shifting like that.

The impact of these base rate changes varies by geography and capitation category across the state and average to an approximate 10% decrease based on Magellan's current membership mix. A portion of this rate decrease was due to reduction in the state fee schedule that largely passes through to providers. Note this decline in the base rates is consistent with our previous expectations. It's also important to note that the state has not yet released the risk adjustment model that gets applied to a plan's base rates.

The shipyards and principally the South Korean yards have used their domestic political impact to offer discounts and other incentives to drive orders. Such speculative ordering reduces the value of the entire world fleet for everyone. The impact of this spike in order activity is likely to prolong the current market conditions, implying a lower for longer freight cycle."

What I can do is give you a little bit of color around kind of our thinking about that from a strategic perspective. And I guess I would start that part of the discussion just by reiterating that we've not made a determination where we will partner or when we will partner. We -- I think the -- I think it's highly likely that we probably will partner at least some countries outside of the U.S. We may partner all countries outside of the U.S. What I can tell you is we do have a very clear plan for the optimal timing that we believe -- an adoptable time range, I guess, I should say, for having those kinds of discussions and making those kinds of determinations. And I would just simply note that if we do partner pimavanserin outside of the U.S., I would just remind you that it's not a matter of just partnering PDP, right? You typically don't split indications. That's going to get extraordinarily complicated. It's been done unsuccessfully a number of times in the past. We don't plan to repeat that experience here. And so there's a number of factors that will feed into the precise timing of those discussions and our decisions around them, but I would simply say that we look at it holistically in terms of the program and the potential franchise, which covers multiple indications, not just as a potential PDP partnership."

And also here, do you think some 5G sharing on this these markets really works? Are you ready to share a 5G network? Maybe it's going to be more efficient for all the shareholders if you do that. And second question on the retail network in Russia. Based on the presentation, I understood that basically you have your own agenda on the retail network, first like expansion and then potential optimization. What do you think about the steps from your competitors? How reliant you are on the steps?

The LED market is an exciting emerging opportunity for Pall. These are semiconductor light sources with the manufacturing process similar to that used to make IC devices.

As I talked about earlier, we're already seeing benefit in the spring around size optimization, clearance in logistics and we think that ramps up as we get into the fall.

As for the impact of the recategorization of the lighting lamp glass products and industrial glass products, on a quarterly basis, was about JPY 3 billion on net sales.

It allows the RVA client to sit in the background and verify the readability of all the data on each of their individual tape cartridges. Now customers love this feature, especially these large environments, because their only option other than what we provide would be to fully -- either restore all of their data or send it out to a third party, and all of this is very costly in both money, time and of course, security risks. Now the solution is really great. They love the feature and everything else, but it requires us to actually control the physical tape media. And this puts us in conflict with the applications that are normally used to writing and reading the data. So the challenge is, they like the feature, but it doesn't really integrate well in their environment. So we've been able to develop and will be releasing in this quarter, mechanisms to integrate with certain of these applications, and that gets rid of this problem going forward. We've had some pent-up demand, especially in Europe of different opportunities that we're just unable to fulfill until this capability comes out.

So now, more and more that you will see profitability coming in countries where we have those losses with 0 value in the books, you will see those type of reversal. It doesn't mean that we'll always be the same as this quarter. This quarter, we made some tax reorganization that give us the chance to book some tax losses in some countries where we are profitable already.

So most of the time in the banking industry, core earnings are something which you can count on, and it's pretty much, generally speaking, recurring earnings.

This means that over the year, we have had, depending on the way we look at it, either 3 or 4 price increases. On the cost side, although we have just experienced a favorable evolution in terms of raw material, mainly due to wood mix, with less imports and more local acquisitions, we should consider that some additional imports will be required in the next quarter and there is still a structural lack of wood supply in the Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, we don't anticipate any further reduction in this cost item over the next months. There are other factors which could trigger a degree of instability in the paper market in the months ahead. The impact of the anti-dumping measures initiated by the U.S. authorities against a number of paper manufacturers are requiring these producers to apply high margins to their prices when exporting to this market will for sure cause changes to the balance between supply and demand in a number of regions, in particular, by increasing the pressure of supply in countries such as Asia, Latin America and Europe.

Other than this, this black swan event of COVID-19 that has happened, we have not seen any other event like this for the last 16 years, where travelers have stopped going. So as you know, we have won contracts for new governments like Portugal, U.S., Cyprus, Brazil, Lebanon. So we are continuing to expand in different geographies, different governments. And we do not see a risk of particular events. Maybe temporary risk would be there if there's -- an event happens in particular part of the country, maybe for a week or 10 days, people do not want to travel and take the measure of safeguard. But then the travel resumes. Until date, we have seen that travel is increasing. The fact that we are working with many different governments also diversifies our risks."

But if you actually parse our international business like I've had a chance to do, we are being well received in the more developed countries. So for example if we look in Europe, well received in United Kingdom, Germany, Nordics, Netherlands, those are typically the places. In Asia, I would point to Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Japan as 3 examples. So you would expect us to invest here and do much better than we're doing even now in these countries next year and the year after. Having said that, I think as you rightly pointed out, there is a national risk aversion to new technologies in some of these international countries, and I think the success of the U.S. will naturally help in followers internationally. So, I believe, our timing and our investment is appropriate right now. It isn't really missed opportunity, but we expect to see the fruits of our labor in the next 1 to 3 years."

This will be driven by a robust political ad environment that is underpinned by growth in our traditional radio business as well as continued growth in our digital businesses, driven by podcasting. This strong revenue growth, particularly the impact from political, which is our highest-margin business, in combination with the operating leverage we are seeing as digital grows, is expected to drive adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digit range, and we are projecting adjusted EBITDA margins in the 28% to 29% range. Given the benefits of our modernization initiatives, we feel highly confident in our ability to deliver against that expectation."

So it is coupled not only with expected new business closes but also sequential improvement, just based on the pace of the opening. There's a bigger expectation, I think, in Europe right now that the calendar Q3 is going to be stronger in Q2, just based on the way they ultimately shut their country down relative to COVID. I think there's a higher expectation that there'll be a stronger recovery. We're certainly -- we're trying to be as agile as possible in that regard, Ghansham, just given that each country, each region is different. Germany is going to be different than the U.K., which is going to be different from Italy. But we feel very good. We feel very confident that we'll see sequential improvement in the quarter. And to your point, most industries have not been holding on and carrying a tremendous amount of inventory as they've been weeding that off over the last several months, of course.

What I can tell you is we're looking at where can we get the best leverage for our spend, and not having to necessarily spend the same dollar twice or the same dollar repeatedly year after year. So some of the spend is foundational and that is onetime. But what I will also tell you is we're bullish on our opportunities in some geographies and channels where we'll probably have more foundational spending next year. If I use a metaphor of this being a house, I wouldn't say we're quite filled out the footprint yet of the house with the foundation to build upon. And that something that we're eager to do and we're emboldened by some of the results that we've already had. So one thing that I can assure you is -- and I've said this in a couple of public places already, we have a small margin for error in how we spend our money. And we are very diligent and very disciplined in making sure that the spend that we do is probably going to, both, return the most in the short-term and set us up for the most success in the long-term. So the foundational spending, some of it, yes, is onetime, there will be more onetime spend. And then we'll look at the most efficient ways to make sure that we can continue to spend at a level that leverages that foundational spending on a forward basis."

And just for your interest, the particularly interesting item on this partial list is the well-attended Responsible Citizen workshop initiative that we have been holding at Kibali in collaboration with civil society. And the aim of this initiative was to sensitize ordinary people to their civic duties at a time when the authorities tend to be distracted by political issues in the DRC. And again, we are a very big part of the communities in all the mines -- in all the countries we operate in. We've realized that as more and more we have to play a role in that actual real civil society and being a partner to the communities in which we live."

We accomplished a lot in 2010, so you can see why I'm so proud of how our organization responded. As we look forward in 2011 over the near term, we expect that our long-cycle business will remain choppy and competitive. Also, we have seen our short cycle business volumes begin to improve, and as volumes continue to pick up, we expect the price will follow, which is important when you consider the increase in material costs. As we have talked about, we expect that the first half of 2011 results will be a tough compare in the first half of 2010, primarily resulting from the lower margins in backlog as we come into this year. When you look at Q1, we'll see particular pressure from reduced absorption levels, planned realignment expenses and forecasted remaining dilutive effects of the Valbart acquisition. We're also currently monitoring developments in the Middle East and North Africa. While we believe the long-term fundamentals will remain in place, protracted unrest may impact the timing of investments."

And therefore, either way, we're fine. In terms of Turkey, we have already indicated in the past, we are very happy with our stake, and Garanti is a critical part of our portfolio, very strategic. The country has long-term potential because of the demographics. It's going through some uncertainties and because of the geopolitical events and the coup that took place in mid-July. But we remain fully committed to that bank, which is really demonstrating very strong performance and we believe in the long-term potential. Right now, we are also very happy with the 40% stake, and we have no plans to change that in the near future given also how large Garanti is and the weight it already has in our allocation of capital at the group-wide level.

Slide 7 shows our key financial performance metrics for the quarter, excluding the notable gain this quarter of $555 million and last year's $90 million of nonrecurring items. As Brian mentioned, diluted earnings per share were $1.40, up 9% year-over-year on good results across our businesses. Revenue growth continues to be strong at 9% year-over-year with higher net interest income from both half the growth [ph]  and improved net interest margins partly reflecting the maturity of higher cost funding. Stronger noninterest revenues, including higher underwriting, banking fees and security gains, along with positive impact of foreign exchange, also contributed to the increase."

And so before we burned through a lot of cash and hiring a bunch of people and really trying understand, do the tools work that we've created, is the messaging resonating with customers, we wanted to really first understand the question, is the product promotionally responsive? And I'm really proud to say that within the first 30 days of launch, we saw an immediate trend reversal from an 8- to 12-month decline into a growth trajectory for NRxs. There's been a lot of confusion on how many sales reps we have out there. I want to clarify for you, this data right here is based on 42 sales reps, approximately 1/10 of the effort that Sanofi had out there from the sales force reach in frequency and coverage. We expect this NRx trend to achieve, roughly by the end of Q4, where Sanofi ended the year in Q4 of 2015. So while we've done this with minimal resources, we're excited that we can see that impact in such a short amount of time. As I can tell you, having had many sales forces over the years, it sometimes takes 3 to 6 months for a new rep to make an impact in any given geography."

We also hedged the P&L on let's say on an opportunistic basis based on the outlook that we have and the risks that we see in the different countries. Right now, we have fully hedged the pound and the Mexican peso and 75% hedged the expected results that we have in Brazil. The cost of that in the first quarter was EUR 60 million.

As we expected when we gave our first quarter outlook in March, the challenges of weather, the heightened competitive environment and the current economic environment continued to impact our sales. However, as we reported today, our first quarter sales performance proved to even be more challenging than anticipated. As we said in March, as the weather normalized, our sales trends improved. We saw a turn in our business during April, even as we take into account the Easter shift. That momentum has continued quarter-to-date. In quarter 2, we are seeing strength across both our consumables and the non-consumable categories. The impact of the inclement weather across much of the country affected each first of the month in the quarter, typically the strongest sales week, so we essentially lost the opportunity for sales across the first of each month."

So there will be some disruption there. Our funnel is good right now. We have a really good funnel. And then also, we're seeing a lot of demand for our combined solutions that we're selling. As I mentioned, we've sold some big deals to some Fortune 500 companies. We're selling in the small and midsized space. We're seeing a lot of demand for our managed office products. So we're confident that we're going to see increasing demand in the second half of the year. And yes, we are up in the first quarter, but we expect -- we need more acceleration to hit that revenue stability that we expect into the second half of the year, so that's what we believe is going to happen. And we believe we have plans in place to help make that happen, including the expanded distribution, along with the unified approach, combining our cloud and hosting and network sales teams and leadership."

However, I will say that the issue about focusing away from fossil fuels is a big mistake. The administration needs to focus on natural gas as the way in the near-term out-of-the-box and out of the heavy dependent on foreign sources of oil. So yes, we'll see. If that happens, we'll see less dependence in demand for oil domestically but if you focus on -- and there are a lot of predictions about that but if you focus on the supply side -- look at what's happening in Mexico with Cantarell and the other places around the world and with the delay on the normal cycle of getting this new Brazilian production online. You're going to see, again, demand imbalances where prices will spike up for oil. So in the long-term, we believe oil will still be a very important commodity around the world. It's very difficult to wean the world off demand for fossil fuels. So we all, in theory, believe that wind power, solar power, heavier use of nuclear power for electrical generation and other sources are a good thing.

I think what Ananth was trying to highlight was that in quarter 3, we had a fairly low emerging market base because quarter 2 had, on account of these -- the sanctions, the Middle East had -- there was probably buying that happened more in quarter 2 versus quarter 3. And now, I think in quarter 4, hopefully, that will stabilize a lot more, and that will continue. And the receivables will go up because the base will be going up.

And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed Military Qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras is something that's quite relevant today. And particularly as we look at opportunities in places like the Middle East, where some of the unrest there is driving demand for more control Security and Surveillance-oriented solutions. As we add capability, things like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive.

I think the economic growth in the country has not fully taken place. The loan demand as you see is recovering, but still not fitting what we believe should be the norm. So that still gives us a certain point of concern. There are no specific loans that we have in mind here, but nevertheless we still could expect deterioration on the credit side. And as part of that \"could,\" as part of that possibility, we still maintain our cost of risk guidance of below 2. At the same time, I would just point you that below 2 also includes the current cost of risk of 1.5. So it does not mean that we expect it to be at 2. We of course would like to see it moving much closer to the current levels and hopefully even below that. But at this stage, there is still a lot of uncertainty on the -- just macroeconomic front that we'd just prefer to keep our guidance intact."

So there's a lot of variability in yields and given our geographic -- the diverse nature of our business from a geographic standpoint, it's hard to take a specific trend. My guess would be, we will hold on to some of the yields because we've taken specific and direct action in these procurement and purchasing initiatives. And at the same time, as you mentioned, we will have some downsizing in terms of yields with regard to pricing that is more market driven, as we go forward. But we've been working with our clients on an on going basis to address cost-savings opportunities for them and we've had good success in maintaining reasonable yields even when we had to adjust pricing to work directly with our clients. So that expansion obviously has elasticity. It's not going to last forever and as you point out, we'll have tougher comparable as we go further into this year because of the yield expansion that started to occur towards the end of last year. But it certainly an area of focus for us and we do have some ongoing room to continue improvement in this procurement efforts. We're working both at the corporate level with our carrier partners and additionally, at the spot level when appropriate to be able to keep our cost low on the procurement side and then be able to share portion of those costs with declines."

Also, I just would mention, for 2Q, when you're looking at it, we did have the benefit of some licensee  settlements that we called out in our press release last year, so that's going to be a comparability factor in 2Q.

And so I think you are going to, every now and then, see those large boxes get sold in the market, but really it's going to be more of a monthly recurring, as you mentioned. If you look back over the last 3 years with SystemMetrics, consistently, their first quarters are -- tend to be lighter than the rest of the quarters throughout the year.

However, the inconsistent patchwork of state and local government orders have created an uneven demand environment, the extent and duration of which remains to be determined. This, in turn, has resulted in varying impacts to our business across geographies, channels and customers into April. As examples, we are seeing double-digit growth in home centers, which is partly offsetting lower activity in independent retail locations, many of which are closed. In commercial, as I mentioned, most education and health care projects are moving forward. At the same time, many commercial projects such as those in the retail and hospitality sectors have been postponed. These factors, together with the broad-based social distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines, have resulted in a softer demand environment."

Within fluid solutions, our electronics product line was up double digits, which was more than offset by softer HVAC sales and known headwinds associated with product rationalization.

Throughout the crisis, our subsidiaries have developed a very robust cost culture. And there was already reduction of around EUR 100 million from the peak of 2008, which translates to 27%. And of course, it's also evident in our Q1 results that there is a 6% further improvement. As it was already stated, we have undertaken a significant rightsizing exercise, and of course, our aim was to further rationalize the cost base and, of course, the footprint in Europe. All in all, we were targeting and we are still targeting to a leaner and more efficient operations. The main key pillars of this rightsizing are the centralization of operations, the centralization of remedial management to become much more efficient and, last but not least, network rationalization. More than 70% of these initiatives have been already completed in late Q1, but we have still to see the impact, which have not been fully depicted in our results. So there are more to come in the second and third quarter. Of course, as we have committed, we regularly review our operational model, and we intend to leave actually no stone unturned in an effort to further improve the cost base. As far as the geographies is concerned, the majority of the initiatives that we run in Romania and Bulgarian and at a lesser extent in Serbia."

But at Cessna, we are in the same mode that we've been in for a few years here, where we're taking orders and selling in sort of a 3- to 6-month window for the most part. And I still worry about the back half of the year in terms of what the market's going to look like. And that's just driven by, I believe, a lot of uncertainty in economies. I think there's a lot of concern about heading toward November, a lot of small midsized business guys who are our customers are very concerned about the balance of the year and where things are going in terms of election and politics. You've got debt ceilings, you've got sequestrations. You've got massive changes to tax policy. So I remain concerned that we'll have too many people sitting on the sideline as opposed to guys that are willing to make significant capital investments and hiring people and things like that. So I think it's proven at this point, given the uncertain nature of the economic and political situation particularly in the U.S., that we'd be a little bit cautious about the second half of the year."

On Slide 12, in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the total revenue decline of 4% on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 8% negative effect from FX this quarter with the favorable volume effect of 3% and favorable price effect of 1%.  By geography, you'll notice the U.S. pharma revenue increased 3%, driven by price, partially offset by volume. In international operations, Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE, you'll see that there was a decline in revenue of 19%. It was almost entirely driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. While on a constant currency or performance basis, ACE revenue decreased just 1%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales, resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity."

So overall, a very diversified business and we did not see any material change in customer behavior in governments. We believe that because we participate in the IP part of the security market, which is early stage and growing, it presents a lot of opportunity for our customers to conduct their security operations more effectively. We don't believe that there is any material change in the customer demand for IP solutions. We do see a lot of interest in some of our new products. We do have the ability to aggregate information from a lot of different sources and to fuse information and then distill it through analytics and allow our customers to make better security decisions based on Actionable Intelligence. So with that, we think that the main growth drivers in the market remain intact and the growth drivers are as before, heightened level of security, generally, and certainly, increased interest in IP solutions and IP analytics solutions, which is the portion of the market that we play. And with these growth drivers intact, we do believe that our prospects for next year are to grow at least at the market rate and potentially take market share."

They still think that '17 is going to be a transitional year from all of the malaise that they had into a better environment. But if the government continues down that track, that '18 should become a better year for the country.

While the pace of U.S. exports has been strong so far, the outlook for ethanol exports has become somewhat more muted given the political and economic uncertainty associated with the U.S.-China trade relations, which has hampered what might have been a more significant seasonal improvement in margins.

The only research, which happens across the country, is IRS. And therefore, that research is going to be the main research for the radio industry going forward. Also remember, IRS is not only a readership survey, IRS covers all media. Did you know that IRS also gives television penetration data, it gives digital penetration data, it gives radio penetration data and also covers hundred -- thousands of different brands and the return all that. So it what is called a 1-point or a one source -- it's called a single source research, and it is going to be the currency in the future.

We're handling it day-to-day, and it is premature to make any kind of predictions in terms of the impact of the sanctions, either on sales or on margin. What I can say that our commercial team is in place. Everyone's back from holidays. We're talking to suppliers across the categories. We are talking to traders. We're looking at alternative markets. The picture is mixed there with, of course, the fear, and our primary concern is our customers. There is always a concern that substitute products might be more expensive. We don't think that's going to be general statement across -- general results across the board, but it is really too early to say at this point. It very much depends on the specific product and the category. In terms of food and vegetable, it depends on seasons. It's going to depend on the weather as we move into fall in the northern hemisphere and into spring in the southern hemisphere.

Interest rates have dropped back down and expectations for a normalization in rates have been pushed further into the future. And along with them, the revenue upside we will reap as a result of our deposit-rich balance sheet. Capital, leverage and liquidity requirements are still evolving, but generally in the direction of a tougher regime, marked by higher funding costs and lower returns. We are supportive of these changes which have made the banking system much more robust, but the burden of implementing them is not insignificant, particularly given that many of the rules are still in flux. In this environment, it's important to be patient and stay faithful to our long-term strategy of growing our businesses in line with our risk appetite.

So by conducting the paired studies in DME, we're able to generate additional data on the safety, efficacy and durability of KSI-301 in this area of high unmet need and commercial opportunity, while also narrowing the number of sites in countries that's required for successful enrollment of the entire pivotal program. So we expect the majority of research sites to be located in the U.S. with contributions from certain countries in Europe, China and potentially Israel. Given that we're currently seeing continued new patient enrollment and low missed visit rates in DAZZLE in the U.S. through the pandemic, we believe that refocusing the KSI-301 program and narrowing our -- the focus in terms of number of sites and countries will really help us minimize uncertainty with respect to trial conduct during and through the pandemic towards our 2022 vision."

Moreover, the Walmart relationship and our unique civilian outreach program represents potential positive influences that can't be currently forecast beyond the current quarter."

Importantly, two protests of significant contracts have recently been resolved, which should benefit growth in our second half. We now have the transition activities on the TSA ITIP contract, the $492 million award we won over a year ago, to begin in early September. The Army's R2-3G contract is a significant ID/IQ vehicle with a $16.4 billion ceiling. Its predecessor contract was one of our largest contract vehicles. And the lack of new task order flow over the last 18 months has been a headwind for the business. Now that this protest has been resolved, we expect task orders to begin to flow again over the next several months."

Clearly, the military has really come to understand the benefits of the 400, what the 400 can deliver, and they, I expect, will have growing requirements for the 400 but they're not necessarily going to be exclusively going forward. We have ongoing discussions, Kevin, with the military about their long-term demand and their long-term forecast and how they may contract. At this point, I don't see the military moving into a ACMI environment the way the commercial customers do. Some of that just have to do with the nature of government contracting and the rules and regulations under which they can contract and/or are allowed to enter into multiyear agreements. I think where we are today, the nature of the contracting, the nature of the kind of spot market rate, cost-plus rate, in effect, which the military pays under CRAF is advantageous to Atlas going forward."

Marlin's asset syndication program remains very active, and during the second quarter, we sold $57.6 million of assets that generated an immediate net pretax gain on sale of approximately $3.3 million. Among other attributes, the syndication program enables Marlin to achieve portfolio optimization by better managing its overall size and composition in terms of returns, credit risk and exposure to particular industries, geographies and asset classes.  Importantly, we continue to service the assets sold, which allows us to maintain an ongoing relationship with these customers, which complements our direct strategy.

Now most of you have heard me say many times that I look at our business over the longer-term and that performance in a particular quarter is not as important as the long-term trend of our business. Our progress in this quarter should be viewed with this perspective. Our global business and our results are subject to ebbs and flows of many things, including change in foreign currency exchange rate, political unrest, from the changes in input costs, just to name a few. However, while we expect to see fluctuations in our sales and in our financial results in particular quarters, we anticipate seeing continued growth driven by our strategic initiatives, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns to our stockholders over the longer period. Therefore, our fiscal year 2015 guidance is as follows: This guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestiture activity; we expect our global fiscal year sales to be in the range of $398 million to $430 million and that's a growth of between 4% and 8%. We project our gross margin to be better than 52%. That's a slight upward revision from our last quarter guidance. We expect our global advertising promotion investment to be in the range of 6% and -- to 7%. We expect our net income between $45.1 million and $46.4 million, which would achieve a diluted EPS of between 3.07 and 3.16, assuming 14.7 million weighted average shares outstanding."

One is the capital markets are a multiple bigger in the U.S. than they are in Europe. And the capital markets driving the performance of U.S. banks as opposed to their own balance sheet is much more significant in the U.S. and in Europe. The second component to that is -- interesting enough on the back of Basel I, where the decision was that a AAA Security pose 0 risk and, therefore, had no capital against it. The only regulated plans and decisions that didn't fully follow Basel I were the commercial banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Without these critical services, provided through a single ubiquitous AI operating system that supports both cloud and on-premise deployment, customers will be forced to distribute their data to countless point solutions, increasing their security and data privacy risks and adding significant complexity to their IT infrastructure."

In the short term, the price of commodities is getting buffeted by a lot of factors. I'd say right now, it's around speculation of what's going to happen with interest rates in this country, which seems to have effect on the dollar. And that's having effect on base metal prices. So it's hard to speculate in the short term. In the long term, if Glencore goes through with the capacity reductions they're talking about, we heard about some other potential mining closures today of other zinc producers, if those things come to fruition and they're of the volume and size that they're talking about, that should have a positive effect on zinc prices."

And I'm probably -- over my years, I have been more of an optimist than a realist around that, and I think I'm starting become more of a realist, trending towards a skeptic, really around the ability of Congress to actually take on a larger issue like tax reform. I think because of the way political cycles work today with 4-year Presidential Election cycles and 2-year House cycles. I think the reality is, is that there's a very, very short window of time when a -- such a significant piece of legislation, like tax reform, would get done. And I think about the only time it can get done is if you've got alignment between sort of the White House, the Senate and the House. And even then, it sort of has to go on within kind of the first year of a 2-year term. So I don't really see any possibility, despite discussion. I don't see any possibility that much is going to change in 2014 or 2015, then we'll have a Presidential Election in 2016. And then depending on how that lines up, you could see, I think, a kind of narrow window in there in the post-2016 period. But I think before that, it's going to be most between that and the 2016 election, Randy, it's going to be mostly political posturing and discussion about what each party would do if they had sort of control of White House, Senate and House.

Since Nick Thadaney joined us in the beginning of September as new Head of TMX Equity Capital Markets, his daily calendar has been dedicated to meeting with a broad cross-section of clients and stakeholders across the entire country, with a goal to identify the key issues and impacts and begin to build workable full-spectrum solutions.

I think you were quoted saying this morning, whether comment from you, Dr. Peter, that 6% to 6.5% R&D could be the new normal for next few years. I think at the beginning of the year, you said, you would deviate from your usual 5% to 5.5% more towards 6%, but 6.5%, I heard that for the first time. So I just wanted to double check if this is the guidance going forward, and what actually has changed that, that drove the increase -- the further increase in R&D? My second question relates to autonomous driving and your partnership or your collaboration that becomes bigger and bigger. I was a bit surprised to see FCA joining that collaboration project. Does it essentially mean that it's really all about economies of scale and there is no way to differentiate as a brand i.e., will FCA vehicles, which clearly have not been known as the innovation leaders in the industry, have the same technology on board as BMW vehicles? And lastly, we had very poor diesel, overall, monthly data from Germany and the U.K. in October. Could you just share the BMW specific trend, is it following this 9, 10 percentage point decline we're seeing for overall market in those 2 countries? And if so, would that trigger any change in terms of your strategy as far as implementation of mild hybrid 48-volt technologies concerned?"

They're very being very careful about declaring any kind of victory or possible victory with their -- inside their country because they just don't know what's going to happen with President Trump.

I think, it's really 3 that I'd referenced. Obviously, the big milestone for the year was closing the transaction with Thompson Creek, which is really the first and second bullet points. It definitely transformed the company in terms of our geopolitical risk profile and you really see this in the pie chart that is illustrated here in the top right. This pie chart is just showing the distribution of the company's net asset value just based on consensus, sell side research. And as you can see when you look at the North American piece, being Canada, just under half of our value is now domiciled here in North America. Whereas, Kyrgyzstan, in terms of Kumtor is being now reduced to 33%. So we think that's going to be very advantageous just in terms of our valuation, multiples moving forward, just given the more favorable geopolitical risk setting in terms of where our value is domiciled. The other key theme, I'd reference, the third bullet point here just in terms of our production guidance for this year 2017. As you can see here, we're guiding for up to 795,000 ounces of gold, a very competitive all-in sustaining cost profile. Obviously, we also enjoy the significant stream of copper from Mount Milligan. And just given where we stand in the current metal price environment, we think it's going to position us very well, strong profitability and strong free cash flow generation from these 2 low-cost high-quality operations."

More importantly, the pick-up in job creation nationwide among private employers should have a positive impact on our business as we move through 2012. A strengthening labor market is the best leading indicator of improvement in demand for our nurse staffing services. I believe nurses, most of whom are secondary wage earners in a household, are influenced by how secure they perceive their spouse's job prospects to be. A strong job market generally results overtime and nurses being less willing to work additional shifts at prevailing wages which in turn increases the likelihood of a hospital calling Cross Country to supplement its staffing."

While the pandemic continues to impact many countries today, the second quarter of 2020 was globally the most impacted. North America, Latin America and Europe all grew organically, while the rest of the world was relatively flat. Positive ForEx increased revenue by $39 million or 5% as currencies in most of our markets have improved versus last year's pandemic-driven devaluation. Reported revenue was $1.049 billion, up $223 million or 27% versus the second quarter last year.

With the acquisitions of Mandiant and nPulse, we expanded beyond APT detection to offer new analytical and response capabilities integrated through our Adaptive Defense approach. Our solutions can detect an attack, tell the customer who attacked them and what the attacker is likely to do next. This enables a proactive security posture. When a customer gets an alert, they have context from the attacker within minutes and can block data exfiltration, determine which endpoints have been compromised and contain the attack immediately. This is a powerful value proposition, and it's expanding our installed base, enabling new go-to-market strategies, delivery models and strategic relationships."

We have had and you've seen the reports there around concerns and protests around dewatering a lake that's called Perol. What we've done, we finished the Chailhuagon reservoir, and we've now moved to building and completing an access road between Yanacocha and Conga, so we can actually reduce the impact we have on driving through local communities to access the site. That looks to take through the middle of next year. And then beyond that would be the work to construct the Perol reservoir. We're really waiting, right now, we don't have the permit to be able to dewater the lake into the new reservoir. So that's one of the key items, and of course, we need to continue to work on getting local support. It is interesting to see that here, just a couple of weeks ago, there was a march in support of the project and in support of development in the Cajamarca region that went on.

If you look at our position in Spain where we went after the acquisition of -- where we were in 2017, the acquisition we did of Xylazel and now of Titan, it really resets a major European country for us, both in impact and also into performance for us. So that continues to be the case. Now what firepower is concerned for potentially bigger deals, I think we do have firepower enough for doing those. So I don't think that one necessarily is in conflict with the other. So I don't think you should read any real decisions in there. So that's on the second question."

This region has high spot market exposure, which has helped us over the past several quarters. In fact, as recently as April, we had utilization over 90% when the delay started. How high is our spot exposure? As of right now, we have about half of our revenues in the region contracted for Q3. This compares with 2/3 in the U.S. and about 3/4 in the North Sea."

We don't know exactly when that's going to be. But we want to make sure that we're not going to speculate on rates either way, but protect our business should rates increase. We believe they will. And so we've repositioned our assets and liabilities to take advantage of rising rate environment. We want to protect the portfolio's earnings, and potentially maybe there's an opportunity to expand earnings in a rising-rate environment. So it's been an intentional and deliberate strategy that we have communicated several times. We look at the risk-adjusted returns of a senior security versus a mezz [mezzanine] security, fixed and floating, the remedies, the underlying attributes of the investments and make the appropriate ones.

It starts really with the subsurface and, do we see the sort of geology and the potential belowground to make big finds? We then couple that, obviously, with all the aboveground risk, the risk of operating in that country and infrastructure requirements, but importantly, the fiscal terms. And so we look at the fiscal terms to make sure that the rewards, if we're successful, certainly offset the risk. And in many cases, as you look at production sharing contracts, the taxes for the most part are paid on your behalf. It's sort of rolled up into the PSC. We have some very high tax regimes in Norway and Libya that are sort of unique relative to new production sharing contracts that we enter into around the world. So the tax rate is not the big determinant there. It's really what we see, again, as our ability to create very significant value for the amount of dollars that we're exposing there.

First, we strengthened our regional leadership in some key growth regions of the world, those being EMEA and South and Central America, with the appointment of Anthony White and Ron Cruz, 2 very seasoned executives to head those regional go-to-market activities for the business."

We consider these initiatives to be important in preparing for our future growth. We made significant progress in 2017. This progress should continue in 2018, and particularly, the first of 2018 when we expect to complete much of this infrastructure build. As Tyler discussed in our October 2017 conference call, we expect to have further increases in our level of noninterest expense during first half of 2018 as we complete much of the remaining infrastructure build, but we anticipate that rate of increase will subside in the second half of 2018."

In the first quarter 2010, we posted $18.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 24% increase over the first quarter 2009 figure of $15 million. We believe our first quarter adjusted EBITDA figure sustains the inflection point that we obtained in the fourth quarter of '09 and provides evidence that our business model is predictable, successful in different types of markets across the country, able to withstand intense and variable competition over time and proven in both good and bad economic environments."

So one of things, Amitabh, that we mentioned on the last earnings call that I think is important to reiterate, so I actually appreciate the question, is keep in mind the way we count security product or security revenue in general. When someone buys what we call PT appliances, and these are the hard and secure versions of our DDI devices, we count all of that revenue as security revenue. So as we said on last earnings call that will always over time start to skew the DDI revenue because someone buys a hardened device, they're still using it for DDI functionality, but we count that as security. And the reason why we do that is we find it hard to separate. What value should we attribute to security versus DDI? So like we said last time, I wouldn't read too much into the fact that if security grows really highly, then that's a concern about our core DDI market. I don't think of it that way.

We're very pleased with the outcome of the equity raise and we are confident the acquisition of Inversiones Finisterre will be positive on all the measures, and the new stronger balance sheet will allow us to work on further attractive opportunities. I also want to mention, in relation to the political situation in Catalonia, that the board decided a couple of weeks ago to move our registered office from Barcelona to Madrid. The main reason for this was to reduce risks coming from legal and political uncertainties. We remain committed to all our businesses in Catalonia and nothing will change in the way we're operating. And finally, I would like to let you know we are planning to present to you a strategic update of the group. We hope to do this at the same time as we present our full year results on February 27 next year. And that concludes the presentation. Joan and I are ready now to take your questions."

This makes reliable planning nearly impossible right now. Let's take a look at the developments over the past few months. At first, growth forecasts were gradually scaled back. Then in March, they abruptly dropped into negative territory. Countries around the world have not yet presented all their preliminary figures for the first quarter, but the trend is clear. While outside China, January and February 2020 were still significantly less affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the impacts of the lockdown measures around the world became very noticeable in March. According to the currently available figures, global GDP declined by 1.7% versus the first quarter of 2019. This affected all of the major economic regions. At first, it was most striking in China and Europe. Severe effects in countries such as the United States will be seen in the second quarter. Industrial production declined even more sharply than GDP. Global chemical production also contracted significantly by 5.2%. Here too the decline was most pronounced in Asia."

This is not at all simple to be defined in a short call as there are many and varied possibilities. We also have to take into account the renovation of the concession contract, which could \"get in the way\" of these negotiation. We have to take into account the possibility of putting this energy up for auction and put energy -- place it on the free market and make the best of these opportunities that this could bring.

In China, an additional level of regulation will eventually become necessary to offset the environmental impact of the increasing number of vehicles there. The next step will likely be to implement a Tier 3 near-zero regulation. While the timing of such a move is unknown, it is already being discussed within China. Similarly, in Europe, regulators are actively discussing the use of an enhanced regulation and will likely require either a Tier 2 system or adding more diurnal controls to the existing system. Again, as these countries move to higher standards, the likelihood of platform harmonization increases, which can only bode well for our revenue growth. As regulations become more stringent, movement toward more advanced systems and larger canisters will continue to increase."

We are relatively late in the cycle, and we don't have any concern as far as demand for our product and services is concerned in 2020.

Our replenishment inventory, which has become a larger portion of our offering and drove our merchandise margin expansion in the third quarter, is in a much better stock position versus last year, when we were consistently out of stock in key styles and sizes. However, our in-transit inventory at year end will be significantly impacted by 2 factors: one, the timing of Chinese New Year, which falls on January 31, 10 days earlier than last year. As you may be aware, there is generally a 2-week shipping hiatus after Chinese New Years as factories shut down and there are limited sailings out of the ports. And two, the recent shipping disruptions in the supply chain in countries such as Bangladesh. In light of these 2 significant issues, we have made the decision to accelerate an additional $50 million of Q1 shipments to ensure these goods are there for our March set-up, our most important floor set of the season. Combining in-house and expected in-transit, inventory on the balance sheet will be up mid-20s at the end of Q4, with in-transits representing 75% of the increase.

But through the first half of next year, we're up on occupancy, up on pricing against a very tough comparison because, obviously, a strong year this year and a strong year last year. So lost momentum in the business for certain. Your comment about optimization of the booking curve, looking at price versus volume at different points and times and the booking curve is absolutely true. We have our new revenue management tool for a number of other brands and we are constantly always optimizing across 10 brands, across multiple source markets and itineraries. And so that is a fair comment. But with regards to momentum in the business, the momentum is very strong."

We have seen charter pricing that has rebounded substantially in Q4 here and you saw the results in Q3 as well. And I think there's a lot of factors driving that. Our focus is where will the environment be in Q1. I think we're taking a fairly cautious approach to that. And the other point I'll make is just capacity constraints. We are waiting, I think, to make an assessment of the Classic fleet and some of the decisions that we'll look to there later this year. And if Commercial Charter demand stays at the level or even improves, I think we'll need to make some decisions around potentially bringing some more capacity online. I would say that our forecast is not assuming that sort of robust scenario, where we would keep capacity to fly that business and where you see continuing strength in the yield. So we're hopeful there's some upside to that, as we said earlier, to the extent that the market improves in a more significant pace or sustained pace. And then the other, third variable there is of course, military demand, which we have said or I commented, we're looking at something very similar in terms of levels, but we don't know what the administration's decision is going to be and what troop deployment will look like and/or other troop movements around the world because it's not just our military demand around the world, it's just not Iraq and Afghanistan.

The second line was any attempt by the U.S. to reverse course on IMO 2020 could create market uncertainty, cause harm to the U.S. energy industry. What I'm trying to understand is why was this letter actually sent. Is it because these Senators are building support for IMO 2020 because they see the benefits?

If you look at it security costs probably gone up 24%, cleaners nowadays, 24% because most people want to work in a resort rather than in a shopping mall. So I think the 2 IRs have sucked up a lot of all these kind of labor. But in a way, the way we put it across our team is take it as a challenge because OpEx will keep going up if we're not careful. So this is where we, again, push ourselves to see how it can be more productive. For example, when it comes to security, maybe we can then put in more CCTV and then we take away the human element for security and so on. So these are the things that we will look at, the use of bit of technology such that everything may not be manual and we will save some costs. Because we all expect debt to keep going up, right? Yes. Because when -- our unemployment now is at 1.9%. It's tough."

We, as you know, had kind of signaled before we made these acquisitions that we were likely to do some kind of a term out either in fourth quarter of 2015 or first quarter of '16.

So I do think in the back half of '16, there is the potential that we will be in the bond market.

So recognizing the problems, the Chinese government is really kind of limiting the use of antibiotics. So and probiotics can be viewed, and often is viewed, as a viable alternative for antibiotics.

Because if we look in Brazil, the last 35 years, the steel market products has dropped by 35%. What is the elasticity for the demand in sales? What should we expect? Should we expect a stronger demand for '27? And in terms of steel again, if you can help us understand, Martinez, by giving your opinion, because all of the protectionism that we have in Brazil, the government now is analyzing an antidumping request of the China and Russia clients. Could you tell us the probability of this, especially given the global conflict? Is there any sense for -- what is the reason why Brazil should act in this way? And another thing is the Integra [ph].

As the concerns over COVID-19 gradually faded, the country entered recovery mode and economic activities gradually picked up during the quarter. Benefiting from such macro trend, we have experienced robust rebound in our operations, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Total net revenue for Q2 reached CNY 3.34 billion versus CNY 3.18 billion in Q1 and CNY 2.23 billion a year ago.

Therefore, I will focus the rest of my comments on changes we are making in our go-to-market strategies to deliver our new solutions to an expanding set and broader audience. Traditionally, FireEye's been very effective at selling to large security-mature customers. They see the value we deliver and continue to renew and expand their deployments. But to meet our long-term growth objectives, we need to expand to a broader set of customers, to go with the broader set of capabilities that we now have. It is clear that we have extended far beyond the sandbox technology that fueled the early growth of FireEye. Helix makes all our solutions even those of other security vendors far better. We are now taking a number of steps to align our go-to-market strategies to leverage that innovation."

While it had no effect on Q1, I would say it's virtually impossible to predict exactly how this will play out as it's beginning to influence global agricultural markets. Let me start by being super clear that African swine fever harms pigs, but there's no impact on human health. But it's swept across the Chinese marketplace, where they are the largest producer and consumer of pork. Current estimates there are that in China, they've experienced a 25% to 35% loss in hog production. Hog futures in North America have rallied as commodity traders bet that China will buy more North American meat. Rising hog prices are expected to alleviate the margin compression that hog producers have been experiencing for more than a year now. And looking further downstream through our vertically integrated business, we are planning ahead and reviewing potential pricing to mitigate expected higher input costs for prepared meats. The outbreak in China has far-reaching effects across global agricultural sectors. Countries are stepping up their protection efforts, as we are in Canada, which already has some of the best biosecurity practices in the world and has increased inspections in the air, sea and land ports."

And number two, for the first time and unfortunately, I've been saying this for probably three years, there is finally some activity going on under FMS, where the government of Iraq has been requesting FMS under the FMS program hardware buys and other things, if you will, from U.S. contractors. Now that is just starting, so you have both the augmentation of the 30,000 troops you mentioned, as well as direct sales to the government of Iraq.

They're buying Android. They're also buying laptops as well, and they're buying some desktops. So they're enterprise organizations. They're large companies for the most part. They're buying a lot of different form factors that have mobility requirements. So in that world, our cross-platform approach, as Rob was getting at, is critical. So our ability to go into an organization and say, \"Look, you're buying -- maybe you're buying more iOS devices this quarter than you are laptops. But your -- for every 100 iOS devices you're buying, you're still buying 20 laptops and maybe you're buying 15 or 20 iOS devices and maybe BYOD, you've got employees coming in with a bunch of another additional mixtures of devices.\" So our ability to have full and deep security and management capability across all of these different operating systems is an absolute clear competitive advantage that we have in the market that nobody else has and that's where we win. And we're gaining more and more traction on that message and theme and our ability to deliver on that requirement, and it's a very real requirement. So just remember when you're thinking about mobility, it includes a spectrum of devices. It's not just one type of device, and we solve the spectrum of device management security issues for these organizations."

The situation continues to be one of high uncertainty, since we still do not know the scope of potential new outbreaks in countries where we operate. A return to life as we knew it is still far off and for now, we must adapt to these unknown conditions. The IMF is forecasting a drop in global GDP for 2020 of 7.2%, while Clarksons is predicting a 4.9% decrease in global container volume, with Latin America being affected mainly during the second quarter and the third quarter of this year. If economies managed to keep the effect of the virus under relative control, we could see the beginning of a slight recovery towards the end of the year, but there is still a lot of uncertainty in this assessment."

Reviewing global economic environment during the quarter, in the U.S., the growth of consumer spending and capital expenditures moderated, and the high unemployment rate and sluggish housing market continued. Although a slow recovery could be seen, concerns of economic deterioration remained. In Europe, the economy has gradually recovered, although conditions varied quite by country. Concerns remain, including the low confidence in the financial system and continued high unemployment. In Asia, while the economy continued to expand in China, the pace of economic expansion moderated in India. The economies of other Asian countries achieved overall recovery although the pace of recovery slowed. The economy in Japan has remained severe due to the impact of the earthquake. Although signs of improvement, such as steady capital spending and consumer spending, could be seen, concerns remain due to limited electricity supply, nuclear power plant disasters and oil price hikes."

Our assessment that the overall economic outlook reflects a slow growth environment, where labor markets are strong and unemployment low overall but they're not evenly distributed across regions and industries. Despite recent progress on trade agreements, the manufacturing sector globally is feeling the negative effect of trade wars and industry-specific challenges, such as in the automotive sector. This is impacting both economic growth and employment and will take some time to moderate. Workforce needs are evolving and skills demands are changing faster due to the adoption of technology and business model transformation in many organizations. As a result, businesses around the world need more help than ever to find, engage and sustain talent. And we can also see evidence of this in our latest talent shortage white paper, closing the skills gap, what workers want. A survey of 25,000 employers and 14,000 workers globally, which is showing record high talent shortages across over 40 countries. Globally, 54% of employers are struggling to find the talent they need, almost double what it was a decade ago. And in the U.S., that figure is 69%.

Middle class and high middle class and high end had a much steeper decline in sales. What I think is important is the pandemic, the quarantine right, social isolation. I think what's important is that the meteor has hit the earth already. And that was in the middle of March, and then April had social isolation. And Brazil as well as other countries had a very drastic impact. So this social isolation, quarantine, lockdown, all of that will come to an end at some point and then we'll resume economy into this so-called new normal. People speak about a second wave, third wave of infection. Maybe there will be many waves, and people have been saying that the virus won't go away too early unless we have a vaccine ready for it. So the middle class and high-end scenario, these people have isolated in their homes. So the sales will decrease much more drastically in that segment than in Minha Casa, Minha Vida.

So if there's any -- in my opinion, if there is any risk to the system would be Class 7. Now what does that mean for Saputo? Not a great deal. We've said it very publicly that we are going to be buying solids on the market, high-quality solids on the market that we will use as ingredients in our make process from countries that can deliver to us at a cost-effective level. We were buying an equivalent of Class 7 from the U.S. prior to the Class 7 being initiated. It's protein -- milk protein isolates that help our recipes, our stabilization of our production as well as our costs. If we have to go back to the market and buy those solids from the U.S., we're not opposed to that. So right now, Class 7, yes, it's cost-effective for us. We can buy solid domestically here in Canada. But if that pipeline should dry up, then we will revert back to buying solids either from United States, Australia, Argentina or any other country that has those solids to offer us that, we believe, can be cost-effective and high quality."

And it's not necessarily around cost reduction, but it's really around what their rate of return is and their hurdle rate internally. That's adjusted for all the risk factors and the macro environment with oil pricing and political or geographic and political risks. And so what we're doing is sitting down with teams with the IOCs and say, okay, well, let us look at this one, and maybe you've got a wrong assumption there on pump life or a different assumption on flow assurance and going back through all their assumptions that built their model and then also putting standardized solutions there that will drive costs down, putting energy on the seafloor and potentially changing the way the SPS looks like on the seafloor. Now with Subsea 7, right, we now have the ability to talk about the handover and the interfaces on the SURF side and the installability of that system.

Volume growth in North America ranged from stable to strong, with a few exceptions, while the softness in Asia and Europe was fairly broad-based but also with a few noteworthy exceptions. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in the quarter, while the impact of currency translation on all 3 segments was a bit more of a headwind than expected. While we're not satisfied with our top line performance, consolidated gross margin on an adjusted basis improved 60 basis points sequentially and was flat year-over-year at 43%. This is encouraging given our expectation that the rate of raw material inflation year-over-year will be highest in first quarter. We expect to see more gross margin improvement over the balance of the year as volumes pick up, the rate of raw material inflation moderates, and we continue to benefit from pricing actions announced over the past year.  SG&A in the quarter came in largely as expected, and we'll continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds."

Patients and clinicians alike can experience higher success rates lessening the emotional, physical as well as financial pain for cycle failure. Health care payers on the other hand can reduce their costs, thanks to the increased productivity of IVF, i.e., fewer cycles needed to produce a baby, as well as the savings coming from less emotional distress in patients and the reduction in multiple pregnancies. The KOLs at our [ real ] investor event clearly recognize these different value drivers of the product. Our initial interactions with peers in several European countries lead us to believe that the potential benefits of nolasiban and its associated value proposition may be well received. Our present focus is now on formalizing the pharmaeconomic analysis in support of nolasiban. We're also in the process of preparing a recruitment of local talent to further plan market access and launch. The major markets of Europe and U.S. hold great promise for us, and we believe a relatively lean commercial organization can address the opportunity in these markets, given the concentrated nature of IVF centers."

For a number of years now, we have maintained that a capitated risk-based model of care would be the foundation of solving runaway healthcare spending and that the prevalent fee for service payment system was in large part responsible for this spending. The healthcare reform debates, and indeed, the Affordable Care Act signaled a seismic shift away from the fee-for-service methodology towards what is now termed accountable care. As well, while many of us feared that Medicare Advantage was at risk in the reform debate and with the political forces, it did, indeed, survive because at its roots, MA is accountable care. The legislation has encouraged non-MA providers of care to develop, as Joe noted, accountable care organizations, and those ACOs to develop and utilize the practices, methods, tools we employ in our business today. We, partnering with our Medicare Advantage payers, are one of the best examples of accountable care at work today."

And so, I think a lot of the features that they are focused on, a lot of the functionality that they've really tried to embrace is a firewall-like functionality for cloud environments.

So when you sort of do the puts and takes here, I realize there's not much change in your outlook, but are there upside or downside risks from your perspective for Military?"

On Page 12, revenue declined by EUR 38 million or 26% in Q2 2018 versus last year. This was mainly the result of an acute -- the appreciation of the euro versus the Argentine peso of 61% versus Q2 2017. In local currency terms, revenue grew 19%, starting to lose ground versus an inflation that is growing above 25%. This difference is a consequence of several factors, including salary increases below inflation throughout the country, significant increases in public service tariffs that impact directly disposable income and the devaluation of the peso. Another factor making it complicated for us to grow revenue faster is the inability to expand capacity. At the EBITDA level though, we were able to mitigate somewhat this decline to 23% or EUR 7 million, resulting in a 0.8 percentage points increase in margin to 22%. As always, the lower margin in the year due to local seasonality issues."

And as we discussed in the past, that institutions are investing in size, they tend to get a fee break relative to the smaller investors. So the easiest way to handle that is to make sure that people have the same terms, and institutions are going to be more able to invest in the longer-dated illiquid products than individuals. So a lot of the fundraising for individuals will be more short-dated, institutions will be longer-dated. And as we package the longer-dated products for institutional channels like high-net worth platforms, basically then what we're doing is we're -- we will have the same fee construct as we do for institutions, which mitigates any potential conflict."

So lot of -- that's a product that's sold traditionally there and it is pretty much aligned -- pretty easy for the state and local team to sell that because it fits well within this area when you talk about police and local issues, community engagement. On the corporate side, there are 2 principal products that have really gotten scale. One is IT Alerting. We'd argue that, that one is a little bit more difficult sale, and that's why we've broken off and announced the hiring of Vick recently as the GM of our IT Alerting business, because the IT professional is different than the business continuity, emergency manager or the security officer, Chief Security Officer or Chief Risk Officer.

And probably worth noting that the buying process for Vimizim in Q2 is already essentially completed. So we have seen material orders for Vimizim there. In terms of uneven buying patterns going forward, I don't think my expectation is that the business will always be Q2 heavy. What I would say is we that have experienced some large and then some very large orders that obviate the need to buy in 1, 2 or even 3 subsequent quarters on occasion, and that's the kind of pattern that I would expect to see going forward. And finally, just a little editorializing, the big orders impact are hard to model and they impact a little bit the interpretation of subsequent order sales. But from our perspective, in a volatile market, getting those big orders is great because it secures product supply for one to several quarters for patients in market."

And it backs up into what we're seeing. Clearly, pulp and paper and alumina have seen declines. And we have a tendency to highlight those because they're larger end-use segments. But at the end of the day, I think it's a broader decline. And I think that's also why we saw the significant dropoff in the middle of the third quarter.

As we indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, we believe that the long-term impact of Section 232 tariffs for Kaiser will be relatively neutral to positive. For our foreign sales, virtually all shipments are covered by long-term contracts, with provisions to pass through U.S. metal prices. For our domestic shipments, industry practices to pass through contained metal costs, although there is typically a lag on certain high value-added noncontract products as evidenced by the margin squeeze in 2017 and the first quarter. A potentially positive consideration is that tariffs implemented on products imported from China and South Africa could serve to eventually moderate the price pressure on general engineering plate products."

I think we've talked over a couple of quarters about -- and I think we've used the word choppiness in the ABRAXANE international totals just because of the different stages of launch there. When we started rolling out in Europe, you get a little bit of top line fill and then we've got -- we use distributors in a few places. So you get irregular order patterns there. And I think what we said was that for a little while, for ABRAXANE total international, you would see that number move around because of those different issues and the fact that we're still on a very modest base. And we certainly saw that from Q3 to Q4. I think what we start to see now in Q1 is a little bit of smoothing out of some of those effects. And as the launches start to fully, in different countries, be in place and that continues to roll forward, I think it's pretty safe to say that the total international ABRAXANE base is something around that number that we saw in the first quarter. And we'll probably not going to see these $20 million to $12 million type of movements anymore, but there still will be a little bit of erratic pattern in that as we continue that. But again, I think that $20 million to $25 million per quarter base number that we saw for total international ABRAXANE is probably a pretty good way to think about it."

And that caused index prices to go up. And keep in mind in the backdrop of that, you had some geopolitical risks supporting ULSD as well as OPEC and Russia talking about restricting production.

The MVX-IPS applies our patented virtual machine technology to validate attacks and minimize the time, resources and money security teams spend investigating false alerts. The typical signature-based IPS generates tens of thousands, to millions of alerts each day, which must be sorted, analyzed and archived even though the vast majority are meaningless. With the FireEye MVX-IPS platform, users get validated alerts on actual security events so they can focus on those that present the greatest risk. They also get a much more comprehensive view of the advanced attacks, they can accelerate the incident response as needed. With MVX-IPS, organizations will be able to reduce spending on ineffective legacy IPS and alert management products, while maintaining compliance and respond to meaningful threats faster; an order of magnitude greater effectiveness at an order of magnitude lower cost. MVX-IPS is in beta now and will generally be available in the first half of 2014 as additional software license and subscription services on the new NX series of our web security appliances."

The Russian customer's not traveling to the extent that she was. The Chinese consumer has changed patterns of travel.

According to one of our largest service provider customers, mobility is experiencing our 4x year-over-year increase in demand for DNS caching performance, which is being driven by the adoption of 4G/LTE and the explosive demand for smartphones, tablets and applications that stretch network services. And at the same time, the transition to IPv6 is become increasingly important to larger mobile service providers, as approximately 30% of their DNS traffic is now IPv6. As a result, service providers have 2 options, they can build multiple server farms to host DNS services, or they can experience the operational efficiencies of several centrally managed appliances at each of their data centers, which also protect their customers and the network from security threats."

The business actually was born -- is largely serving first lenders for repossessed bikes. Over the years, they have diversified their source of powersports vehicle and diversified beyond motorcycles as well. But today, they, and now we, source vehicles both from lenders for repossessions as well as from dealers. The buyers are largely dealers themselves who in turn would sell through their own retail channels. That's been the business model. They've got 5 locations today across the country. We believe there is potential for growth, as I noted earlier, both in terms of geographic expansion as well as further market penetration. The powersports arena is less intermediated than, for example, the car or the automotive universe, and so there's potential in both regard. As for the purchase multiple, historically, as you know, from Universal Salvage in '07, QCSA in '13, we tend not to elaborate meaningfully on those front. This is a compelling acquisition to us financially as well as strategically. We believe it's accretive to us on an operating income basis. And I think that should be illustrative.

But as we, I think, look out to March, I think we feel good about what we're seeing so far. But it's really early in the quarter for us to be really giving any specific numbers yet. But Dave..."

So some of those fields will have declines that range from 15% to 25%. Having said that, I'm just case in point, for example, Rubiales, which we took the operation less than 24 months ago, we've actually been able to increase production in Rubiales. So there's things that we're doing that are working, but we need to sort of run very fast to stay still. And in that sense, we've given a guidance of 715,000 barrels to 725,000 barrels per day for 2018. We're in the range for that number, but we do need to acknowledge that, for example, during the last month of February, we did have some impacts in our production in Meta in our areas of operation around Castilla and Chichimene. There was some social unrest. There were some attacks to the infrastructure, mainly electrical switchgear and some of the other electrical facilities. This was sort of 10 to 12 days ago. We've now managed to reestablish all of the production from the field. So we do see some challenges. I just want to be very blunt in terms of saying that there's always challenges in and around the operation, but we feel very, very comfortable in terms of the guidance we've given of production. To your point, clearly, the challenge that we have and what we'll need to demonstrate is our ability to deploy the CapEx in a way that's efficient that sounds and underpins production growth."

Now that we have been in it for over 4 months, I think it's a good time to reflect on how the impact has been on the various businesses. As you know, the Engineering businesses were closed for these periods during lockdown, but the Sugar business operated without any interruption. We were able to go pretty much contactless for about 175,000 contact points per day across the group in a matter of just 96 hours. So there's a tremendous amount of effort that's put in by the IT teams and by -- and in association with the district administration and the state administration to allow us -- the facility to be able to go contactless. As a consequence, during the initial couple of months of the crisis, we actually had very, very low rates of any COVID outbreak. In fact, we're seeing it ever so slightly now in the surrounding areas. However, the administration and we ourselves are, of course, much better prepared to deal with it and support the local communities in terms of any outbreaks. But the Sugar business, as a whole, as I was mentioning, was able to combat this crisis extremely well. And as a result, we were able to close out the season without incidents."

Our ability to bridge the gap between NetOps and DevOps is resonating with customers, and we are already seeing the power of our combined sales efforts. We estimate that the joint F5 NGINX and F5-initiated sales efforts have increased NGINX's net new Q4 pipeline by roughly 20%. As an example, during Q3, we secured a joint F5 and NGINX win with and APAC-based international telecommunications provider. The customer needed a security solution for its private cloud distributed over 10 major city points of presence. They selected F5 software-based WAF to protect the traffic ingress points.

In terms of our partnership model, it remained the same. In fact, we still provide the loan facilitation services to our funding banks. And earlier, you asked about a question that is the some local commercial banks are no longer allowed to grant loans outside their geographical coverage. Well, in terms of the impact on our operation, my answer is there is no impact on Cango because our partnership banks, for example, ICBC, it is already a national joint-stock bank, and so there is no impact on ICBC. In terms of Jiangnan Bank, it is, a supersized,  a rural and commercial bank.

But concerning the geopolitical in the Eastern Europe, health issues, global conflicts, et cetera, as we kind of move into 2015, if we were to actually see sales, and I don't think it takes much that if we were to see sales maybe decline 10% with the fixed nature of maybe some of that operating cost, obviously, the leverage and the model works both ways. We're sitting in the same position again in -- at the end of 2015 than we are in 2014, with the EBITDA trends for the trailing 12 months.

And just want to try to rank order the drivers of the sequential decline, and our thinking is, it's Forex who's the number one driver of the decline. The second was the geographic mix, which is an ongoing issue, was the second driver. Third was related to tools Susan spoke to find more of long tail keywords which, over time, should drive CPCs higher or certainly assist CPCs. Before, it was the slower economic recovery in Europe versus the U.S., and your comment about Greece, related to that. And fifth was another Susan comment, the product innovations rollout in the U.S. first which, over time, is a rollout the non-U.S. market should help CPCs outside U.S. One you didn't really mention was Mobile, which is probably a factor as well. Is that the right laundry list of drivers of a sequential CPC decline and the right list in the right order in your view, Patrick?"

Year-to-date, our international markets were up 6%. And in the quarter, international sales grew 2%, led by growth across Europe-direct, Japan and Korea, partially offset by declines in our China and international distributor businesses. Europe-direct and Japan's growth momentum continued in the quarter with these markets growing high teens and mid-teens percent, respectively, driven both by DTC and wholesale performance. Our international distributor business was down in the quarter, in part due to timing of shipments and is up low single-digit year-to-date. Geopolitical instability and currency fluctuations can impact select distributor markets in any given year. We believe our balanced portfolio of over 25 distributors across more than 60 markets has proven to be a profitable growth engine that mitigates risk, while extending the brand's -- the brand portfolio's reach beyond our core markets."

However, a recent study by the DoD determined that generators in the field are performing with lower-than-expected efficiency and higher-than-expected failure rates, which has caused issues and increased the maintenance expenses for the military organizations. The primary root cause of these issues is a result of wet stacking, which occurs when the diesel engine operates considerably below rated output level and unburned fuel is passed through the exhaust system. The U.S. Marine Corps estimated that -- estimates that generator life expectancy is 48 months, which is well below the planned 84 months expectation that was assumed when they were purchased. Our Mobile Electric Power -- Hybrid Power source solution addresses this weakness, reduces generator wet stacking and fuel consumption, and delivers clean, stable power, extending the life of existing diesel generators."

This, combined with the pickup in June repayments, led to a rundown in our loan book on a sequential basis. Our net total income was lower by 8% year-on-year at INR 27 crores in Q1. This decline is mainly attributable to: number one, softer yields in the Microfinance and MSME segments; and number two, no booking of processing fees in the absence of disbursements in the first quarter. Furthermore, as a prudent measure, we chose to maintain an ample liquidity buffer and also applied for a moratorium on loan repayments in April and May. This adversely impacted our net total income owing to this negative carry cost."

Now granted, the vast majority of our backlog is really greenfield projects, and those margins have been -- actually, have kind of low loss for the last 4 quarters. So I don't expect any further erosion. Mix will have the biggest impact, and that will depend on some things we talked about. Geographic mix has an impact, but certainly, the greatest of which is greenfield versus MRO. Product mix, electrical versus mechanical, those are also smaller factors that can impact margins quarter-to-quarter. But we -- the price environment has not fundamentally changed, so we do not anticipate any significant changes in margins in the coming year. I think when we begin to see customers pushing project timing, and timing becomes important, pricing -- the pricing environment will improve. And also some of the things I noted, as we begin to see margin -- excuse me, we see volume increase in -- particularly, in our electrical products, we will see manufacturing and absorption improve. And I think, over time, we've got at least 2 points of operating leverage there in the business."

In the quarter, we saw this dynamic with strength in general surgery in the U.S. and in several countries outside the U.S. lifting growth, while U.S. urologic and gynecologic growth moderated. Drivers of growth include U.S. inguinal and ventral hernia repair, colon and rectal surgery and thoracic surgery as well as urology and gynecology procedures outside the United States.

We're also evaluating some expansion to the national commercial leasing side, one, maybe 2 bankers. So I want to be careful with, we're getting further than what we have said because I think, making the investments in the asset generation side is key for us.

But look at our Industrial business, I'll give you some color, we had a drop in our military business over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was pretty flat, but say their last Q3 and Q2 and offsetting increase in revenue from the Techwell security and automotive. It doesn't have the same margins as the military business, there's probably a 20-point margin difference there. So while the revenue is going up, it isn't as rich as you'd find in satellite or military or something like that. It's still north of the corporate average but -- so within the industrial, the mix is going down. And then also for the fourth quarter and then guidance for this first quarter, we're making a concerted effort to reduce inventory on our books. The inventory areas that we're reducing is predominantly the stuff we make internally in our fabs. We built an inventory back in 2010 as we consolidated fabs, and now we're burning that off now that transfer is complete, and we feel very comfortable with the capabilities and the consolidated fab. wW're going to start working up inventory. That's going to cause a temporary reduction in gross margin as we just don't have the utilization that you would normally.

They aren't used to paying those prices in those countries, and they can't sustain that kind of pricing. So in order to sell in those areas, we have to reduce our prices, which a lot of people do and we have done off and on over the years. But the problem is, you get a distributor who will take it and he will act like he's taking it out of the country and divert part of that product back into the U.S. and undercut our own pricing here.

But if I look at North America through the quarter, and including October, North America was stable; had some nice levels through the entire quarter. What we liked was EMEA. If you remember last call, I made a comment about EMEA softening a little bit and moderating a little bit. Wasn't sure whether it was the holiday period. But what we saw in September and October that EMEA strengthened and stabilized at a low single-digit level for us, which is a good thing for the Europe area. Asia Pacific did moderate through the quarter, and Latin America remained strong. So really, that mixture in particular the fact that EMEA got better through the quarter gives us the confidence. And when we look at all the end markets and Lee will take you through this, they really held up quite well despite some of the geopolitical issues that you read about.

Our management team has built several leading companies in the data fusion industry over the past 15 years or so. Data fusion is a subset of big data. We amass billions of disparate data points and we fuse that data using proprietary algorithms to create real-time comprehensive views of individuals, businesses, assets and their interrelationships. In the early 2000s, we built a company called Seisint. Seisint had brilliant technology for its time and was ultimately sold to Reed Elsevier's LexisNexis for $775 million in 2004. We next built a company called TLO, and that company was sold to TransUnion in 2013 for $154 million. These systems have historically served the risk management industry comprised of financial services, insurance, law enforcement, government, collections, legal, corporate security and others for the purposes of due diligence, risk assessment, identity verification, legislative compliance and debt recovery."

But that said, at a macro level, if you look at it, the size, because that we continue to invest and that's been the conundrum that I've been talking to U.S. and other colleagues in the industry, that at this rate, if you want to drive the growth, you have to continue investing because at this size, you can grow only as much and the investment is critical for our growth.

Segment net sales decreased 19.4% over the prior year quarter and have continued to decline as ongoing political tensions disrupt the distributor activity in the region. While Ukraine continues to be the most heavily affected by the escalation of political unrest, other markets in the region are also affected, including Russia and Belarus. In conjunction with the political unrest, the weakness of the Ukrainian hryvnia and the Russian ruble have contributed to lower revenues as our products in the region are priced in U.S. dollars and therefore become more expensive as the local currencies decline in value against the dollar. That said, we remain strongly supportive and engaged with our distributors in the region and continue to support their leadership activity with additional price and product promotions and business-building promotions and training to help achieve sales stability and a future return to growth. Despite political uncertainty, we are pleased that we have been able to maintain service levels to our distributor leaders across these markets through our strong presence on the ground with our local partner and our focus on distributor retention and engagement. As a result of these efforts, we were pleased to see continuing engagements of our distributors in our business as evidenced by the 4,500 people attending our annual birthday convention in Moscow at the end of September. While the attendance was understandably lower than last year, it was an impressive, high-energy event and provides grounds for cautious optimism that the business can recover once stability returns to the region."

Obviously, we tried in this call to be very helpful in giving you an understanding of some of the opportunities and also challenges we face going to 2015. When we look at the year and look at the keys to success for 2015, I think a lot of the prerequisites for a successful 2015 in Insulation and Composites are in place. We feel like we have stable demand expectations of housing growth in the United States, good pricing environment with decent comps here in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year, relative to where we were to the middle of last year, predictable volumes that are giving us very good manufacturing performance, and we'd expect to see the kind of momentum we've had in Insulation over the last couple of years continue through into 2015. We'd expect to see the kind of momentum we saw in 2014 in Composites carry through. I think Michael talked about the offset that we'd expect to see at that momentum due to foreign exchange. Obviously that's a bit of a headwind. It's a translation issue for us. Though it's not a strategic issue. We tend to make product in the geographies where we ship it and sell it.

That may play a little bit different story there. But I would have to say the growth is really a function of everything that we've been working on and executing the strategy. We've had great execution across all fronts, focusing on the customer and speed and putting the right inventory in the right place.

So when you combine the two, yes, we have seen headwinds, which have put pressure on our pricing, but is sort of geographically specific. In the international activities outside of Europe, we are better off because our product manufacturing and our selling is more colocated, so the normal economic conditions that you face in a recession are sort of applicable. We faced some strong pressures in the past year. We don't see a lot of opportunity to raise prices a lot, but we are trying to hold pretty much where we are.

But I would say that, that is the -- the lack of data, at least for us, we are unable to get that data.

And once that testing regime would be in place, and once that would be based on rapid testing technology, then it would be less -- clearly less cumbersome to be an airline passenger. And we think that it is possible to take care of health, safety and control the spread of the virus with rapid testing. Because based on the data that aviation industry has collected across Europe and the health authorities have collected across Europe, and this goes also for Finland, there is no virus transmission effectively on board aircraft. And then also, when looking at people entering, for example, Finland from the high-risk countries, the number of infected people is very low. In case of Helsinki Airport, 0.9% of passengers from high-risk countries are COVID positive, and vast majority of those passengers are not in a stage where there could be anymore infecting other people because they have been having the virus and the disease previously. So therefore, we feel that this testing regime is possible and that would be a key enabler for aviation to start to recover and the amount of passengers to start to increase."

At the same time, we have seen a surge in e-commerce demand as consumers have shifted more of their spending online during the health crisis. This dynamic is reflected in the monthly cadence of our consolidated same-store sales performance as April declined 45%, May declined only 10% and June increased by 3%.  While we believe that the sequential improvement was driven in part by external factors, such as easing restrictions or receipt of stimulus payments, I would like to recognize our stores and digital teams for their superb execution during this challenging time."

As I said in the last couple of calls, we literally had some very big customers that were growing double digits and others that were on the opposite side of that. So it really is more of a customer variability issue than it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've seen for several quarters.

I think the local team have done a really good job at restructuring the business and returning it to profitability and to growth. And credit quality is now excellent. It's the best in the business. Our aim is to rebuild this business over the medium term, up to and beyond where it was before the recession. The external economic environment though, it was improving, its still a bit uncertain. And as in many countries, there is a fiscal tightening going through in Hungary. I think the recent failure, the Hungarian government to agree an extension to the IMF standby facility is added to those uncertainties, but I guess is that will be sensibly resolved in the coming weeks. So in Hungary, we're growing carefully but we've established a strong and a stable platform from which to rebuild the business.

Just to give you a few data point, during the quarter, the euro was about 15% weaker than the prior year, the sterling was 26% weaker. And then both of those markets, HUMIRA® is a larger percentage of the sales base than other products, it's a very large percentage of sales base. Whereas, the yen was about 6% stronger in the quarter and it's a very small percent there because we're still ramping up in Japan. So when you run all these mix effects through, that's really why HUMIRA® has a bigger exchange impact relative to the average products in our International Pharmaceutical business. I think you're can expect that to continue in the third quarter as we'd talked about roughly 6% across the business, across the company is what we would guess exchange is going to be in the quarter, assuming current rates hold.

Foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue of approximately 6% in the first quarter, offsetting this were strong volume growth of 9% and price increases of 5%. For the full year, we continue to expect foreign exchange to be an approximately 3% headwind to revenue. Interest expense was $1 million higher for the quarter and implied by our prior full year guidance, with higher commercial paper balances through the quarter due to the timing of share repurchases. Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $137 million to $143 million, reflecting primarily changes in the mix of foreign versus domestic borrowings as compared to our initial outlook for 2019. The higher levels of foreign borrowing will allow us to more cost effectively manage currency risks in certain countries, in particular, Argentina."

In terms of margin, I think there's an overall margin pressure, it is different dynamics in the different countries.

We had a huge turnover in Q1 and in Q2. Now, we've got more stability because we're replacing, okay, this customer with other customers that fit the network, okay? So now our miles per truck or our revenue per truck is going in the right direction, okay? And now, we're seeing less of a turnover because those guys are making a better salary and they don't sit as much. The other thing also, I mean, if you get rid of people like fleet managers, for instance, and the driver calls and he has to wait 15 minutes on the line to talk to someone, versus one of the best TL in the U.S., you have to wait 15 seconds. I mean, we're talking people here. So this is why like I was saying, we had to reinvest into people because we want to run CFI long-term. We're not there for 6 months or 1.5 years, right?"

But if you take the other parts of Georgia, which we have a significant presence there, Savannah really up to the North Carolina line is Georgia had really an exceptional quarter, and it's had a great year. But really strong growth in Georgia across-the-board. Charlotte has been great all year, continues to be. A lot of opportunities there. We've been -- we just have a great team in Charlotte, and they have -- and we've been building that now for a decade. So really strong fundamentals across-the-board in Charlotte. Charleston has been really good, as you know. But the other parts of coastal South Carolina had been a little softer, but we really saw places like Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach.

So revenue levels, geographic mix and commodity pressures, all very similar on a sequential quarter basis. There are 2 things that are different. One is incentive compensation. And as you know, at the start of each year, we anticipate that we will achieve our full year targets, and so we accrue incentive compensation at the full year budgeted basis.

I mean I think we like to believe -- the part of the reason we're attracting so much talent is because I think we're now seen as a really winning firm is Europe. But I have to admit that some of the reason we're attracting so much of talent, is some of the dislocation in the big 4 over there. I mean, it's -- as you know, Tim, it's pretty serious. And our parts of the big 4 are the most contentious parts of the big 4. They're the parts, which have the most conflict, the most chance of conflict, right? It's bit litigation, it's big investigations, it's bankruptcy. So the big 4 parts that are most likely to get shaken loose by the disruptions over that are the parts that we are specialize in. And so it is a very fertile ground for us right now, and who knows how this sorts out over the next couple of years.

They are basically 3 category. 1 category is the one that we will call the signature base. In the industry, they're referred to the first-generation antivirus software. This will be company like Symantec and McAfee of sorts. And then the second generation are tuned towards -- more towards AI and machine learning and more -- much more lightweight and the player there are the 3 Cs: the Carbon Black, Cylance and CrowdStrike. And then you have the third category, which are more tied to the IoT endpoints, more in the discovery side of the equation. So we are definitely in the newer generation -- second-generation antivirus and cyber security threat detection and prediction technology. So in the second generation, there are 2 major fields: one is called the EPP and one is called EDR. EPP is more on the predictive protection. EDR is more on the remediations -- detection and remediations. Cylance is, at least, from the analyst community -- the industry analyst community, has been ranked #1 on EPP. And so -- and the RSA announcement, the reason I referred to it and this, obviously, is part of our due diligence is they have the newest set of the EDR products also, so they just announced that in March.

The stations in Green Bay and Marquette, as you know, it was kind of a clean-up trade for Liberty Media. It was -- they were kind of a 1.5 station group, if you will, so it fits in perfectly with our strategy of bringing them under our group umbrella, applying best practices, overlaying our retransmission contracts and for all of those reasons, it's an immediately accretive acquisition to the company. It's a very high bar for us in that all acquisitions must be immediately accretive on a free-cash-flow-per-share basis, Green Bay and Marquette fit that. If you look at interest expense and CapEx, about $1 million a year and BCF that will be somewhere between $5 million and $5.5 million per year, depending on odd or even year, and the impact of political. So immediately accretive on a free-cash-flow-per-share basis and leverage neutral to deleveraging. So I would not say that the landscape is littered with opportunities like that, but there may be selectively, one-off or 2-off opportunity that we would evaluate. And again, everything has got to beat our steady-state, pay down debt with free cash flow opportunity, which we think is pretty compelling for debt holders and equity holders alike in terms of the appreciation that can happen just from doing that with our proceeds."

Due to our sudden reopening schedule in May and June, only 7 stores were opened for the entire month of June. Of these 7 stores, 5 stores were in our comp days and saw same-store sales decline of 48.6%, largely reflecting the 50% seating capacity restrictions for these stores.

Other than that, the bulk of the operations in the Middle East were strong.

We've heard rumors of and read in publications about same kind of questions that we get asked, which is the price of oil going to impact future spending. The answer is we don't know.

And those are the likely the ones -- I mean, those are going to be being called also, and the average yield on our investment -- our mortgage-backed securities portfolio is 2%.

So yes, we will still continue to have some TruPS called here and there as the year progresses, maybe as much as $40 million, I don't know.

The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread, and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are -- if you look at our switching market share, although it's actually nudging up, we're still relatively small, and for that reason, the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnect with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we're talking about. And data center is, in fact, the area where we are strongest today from a security standpoint. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build-out of cloud for telecom operators and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with 6 additional wins in the Q4 timeframe alone is really healthy. And we definitely see a pooling of other products along with it.

And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors."

As we have indicated, yes, we've got some significant orders that are shipping out of that backlog and we have some more orders in the pipeline that are coming in behind those. Certainly, maybe not as large as the 2 or 3 that we've highlighted. In terms of geographies, yes, the backlog in Latin America is strong. We've had, both in Brazil and Mexico, some significant orders. There's a couple of other orders that are out there that we're in the midst of bidding on right now, that we have yet to hear on. When we look across the European -- we include the Mid East in our European segment for that business. And the Mid East still has projects going on. The rest of Europe, we don't see too many -- a lot of smaller projects. And then in Asia and Australia, we've seen a little bit lower level of activity in the recent months. Then I didn't comment about the U.S. Canada has been off from a capital standpoint. The U.S., though, continues to have a steady stream of business and both in engineered or order business. And we've also had some success in -- a fair amount of success in shipping product that we've built -- vessels that we built and put into stock that we're shipping out of stock for fairly quick turnaround. So I think the U.S. is still robust. Latin America, very strong. The Mid East, fairly steady. Asia maybe a little bit off and Canada, a little bit off."

There's no universal methodology for climate scenario analysis and approaches continue to evolve. At Kosmos, we've developed a robust process, supported by a leading independent sustainability firm and with guidance from climate experts across industry, the investment community and civil society. In our climate modeling, we looked at the ways in which different transitions to a low-carbon economy could impact the value of our assets. We've selected 3 external publicly available scenarios outlined in the International Energy Agency's 2018 World Energy Outlook as the basis for our analysis, including a sub-2-degree scenario aimed at delivering the Paris goals. The independent sustainability adviser Critical Resource modeled how the transitions outlined under each of these scenarios would impact 3 value drivers: hydrocarbon prices, country risk and fiscal take. Of these value drivers, changes in hydrocarbon prices have the biggest impact on valuations. However, we recognize that energy transition will have other effects. We therefore incorporated 2 additional factors, country risk and fiscal take, in the countries where we operate into our scenario analysis. Important to note that the purpose of these scenarios is to better understand the relative impacts on our portfolio, and these are not company asset forecasts."

So that's kind of one clue for you. And secondly, of course, Olga, just before you asked about the introduction of sanctions and market volatility, asked -- so clearly, those factors could create a potential for certain deterioration in the loan portfolio. At this stage, we don't see any specific names, but it could happen. So therefore, we just hedge ourselves by saying that cost of risk could potentially pick up. If a loan portfolio resumes growth or gains a significant amount of growth, just simply through the Stage 1, we will be creating additional provisions based on the 12 months ECL for the Stage 1 loans. So that in itself will be a substantial driver given the size of the Stage 1 portfolio that we have."

Of course, my view is that in 2013, we achieved more and more of that.

This was 24% higher than the average during the same period in 2016. The oil price strengthened on the back of continued demand growth, strong OPEC compliance and several supply disruptions in Norway and the United Kingdom. Geopolitical risks, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Libya, also supported prices. On average, gas prices were 16% above Q3 2017 and 11% above the same period last year, given the colder than average weather as well as several unplanned supply disruptions, such as the Forties Pipeline shutdown in the North Sea. The refining indicator margin was down 19% compared to third quarter of 2017, reflecting the strong upward momentum of the crude price."

After driving much of Echelon's growth in the several years prior to the 2008 recession, the smart electric meter market has become a very challenging one. Despite our strong pipeline of sales opportunities, potential projects were not converting to awards due to political, economic and country-specific factors which were beyond our control. The prospects for the market's return remained uncertain, and our significant efforts to reduce cash burn in the Grid business were not enough to offset mounting losses.

Thank you for joining today's call to discuss our third quarter results and recent progress, including contract wins, fleet acquisition plans and the expansion of our aerial firefighting services to new mission-critical areas and geographies. For our third quarter update, the earnings potential of our Scooper fleet was on full display in the third quarter as we experienced the highest level of utilization in the company's history. This drove our record results, including record quarterly revenue of over $50 million and record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $39 million. It was also a record quarter in terms of our territories covered as we flew from East to West Coast of Canada and all the way down to Louisiana. This is a testament to the rapid adoption of our initial attack platform enabled by the Super Scooper's superior initial attack capabilities and our industry-leading surveillance technology."

Obviously, the Asian corporate story, importantly, part of that is China. We think that is a long-term trend. That the surge you're seeing in infrastructure issuance also is something that I think would be a longer term, secular trend.

The chart on the bottom right shows future prices for some of our most important commodities, including corn, soybean, wheat and sugar. Since the beginning of the year, main commodity prices have risen to more attractive levels. In the case of grains, the increase is driven by strong demand and concerns at the political unrest in Ukraine, coupled with the tension with Russia, will delay exports from the Black Sea region as farmers seek to horde production to hedge against inflation and possible devaluation. In the case of sugar, price is down 8% as a result of a severe drought experienced in Brazil's Center-South region, which is drawing concerns that the new cane crop may see yield losses and reduce sugarcane production."

Gross margin was also significantly impacted by currency, but we did make progress with our cost-saving initiatives, which are helping to fund investments in the turnaround and a key reason that we believe we can deliver gross margins about 50% for full year 2015 despite the currency headwinds. With foreign exchange having a significant impact in the quarter and year-to-date, I'll provide some additional color on the currency dynamics before moving into the brand and P&L discussion. In aggregate, currency reduced reported net revenues by $150 million in the quarter and almost $300 million year-to-date. As many of you know, we have market-leading positions in Mexico and Brazil, where the peso and real depreciated about 20% and around 40% year-over-year in the quarter. These markets represent 2 of our largest countries outside the U.S., and currency volatility had a meaningfully negative impact on our reported results. We also saw the Russian ruble weaken by around 40% year-over-year in the third quarter. We expect revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange, but we believe the impact in the fourth quarter will be less pronounced since the U.S. dollar began to strengthen in the fourth quarter of 2014."

So I think the way we see it is that we'll face continuing pressure in Q2 and Q3, not unlike Ken described with mostly network-only kinds of customers that were just tapering off, and that had been going on for some time. It's not a vertical per se. It's just more in the horizontal services versus the vertical solutions. In the vertical solutions side, I think our newer products have a solid ARPU, maybe a little ARPU pressure in the security, but it's the network piece that has the most pressure, and that's a function of 2G, or we weren't working with those customers closely or adding value. I think we're remedying that with several new platform releases and capabilities that really enhance the network-only offer. So the way we see it is Q2, Q3, you face continued pressure. The sequential growth starts in Q4. So you've got a turn coming up in the near term of the business. And then you have -- the goal here is that we continue to grow on a sequential basis organically. And Mike, I know you have followed the company for some time, and that's, I think, something that we haven't necessarily had. In the past, it was lumpy.

We talked last time about how data-driven advertising would be on the front foot as that happens. As much as the global financial crisis of 2008 and '09 caused many advertisers to consider data-driven strategies for the first time, I believe this crisis will cause advertisers to leverage more data more aggressively than ever as they look to make every dollar work as hard as possible. And we started to see this play out through our second quarter and into the start of the third. Since ad spend troughed in mid-April, advertisers have been returning and reactivating campaigns, but most of them with new approaches and new creatives, given the environment we're in. They realize that as markets reopen, they have a unique opportunity to gain share. Many paused in mid- to late March and even early April, but some advertisers in all categories have seen this as an opportunity to gain share. To do that, they've had to be more flexible and agile than ever. As markets open in different ways at different rates even within the same country, they are under pressure from their CFOs to prove the value of every advertising dollar, forcing them to prioritize advertising that is measurable and comparable. And they are dealing with a consumer base that is rapidly shifting away from traditional linear television."

We do not see the most worrisome combination of a double dip in the U.S. and a hard landing in China. As a result, we believe investors can take advantage of this excessive fear factor and pursue attractive investments to our proven managers."

There's also significant discussion of increasing revenue via fuel tax increase or other tax increase. I think you're probably correct that it's, if you see any increase there, it's going to be '19. But the fact that they issued $400 million worth of bonds, at least will give us some cushion in '18, that it's not going to get any worse in '18. But we're 40% below the numbers that they used to spend in Kansas on highways. And I'm pretty confident, we'll get back there, but it's going to take a few years."

And I see significant opportunity in expanding our relationships, particularly our G2K relationships and our federal relationships. In most cases, they're only using -- they may be using ITSM in 1 division, in 1 geography. And we have potential to expand our ITSM usage across the entire enterprise. A large number of our new customers are buying ITSM for the whole enterprise but some of our existing ones don't yet have ITSM for the full enterprise. So I see upside in ITSM. Even our largest customers' only using 3 of our products: HR, ITOM and ITSM. So I think we have upside to grow more and more of these large relationships. It's a natural evolution. They are -- many of them are saying we're an important strategic partner. Our platforms, one of the -- they're picking 3 or 4 or 5 core cloud platforms they want to work with. We're one of those. And we see growing usage, both of our -- the prepackaged applications we talk about in these earnings calls, but also of our platform. We don't break out the platform growth but the platform is also growing very attractively as they're building -- using our capability to build other workflows that we don't have out-of-the-box functionality for. And so this whole theme of digitizing the enterprise, automating workflows wherever possible is creating strong demand.

So at the end of the day, we feel very good about where we are. An employee starting today on a full-time basis, it takes about 5 years to get to top of scale. And I think our average U.S. hourly wage is in the mid-22s, 22.5 roughly, which we believe dwarfs any other retail or retail-type entity out there on a base scale. And I believe that you'll see more pressure on it. And by the way, there are some geographies around the country, even before we raise it to $14.50, we were already above that.

But having said that, I think you must realize that we are reasonably well entrenched in Bangladesh. And managing volatility and uncertainty is a way of life. What we intend to do is that -- what has perhaps not happened in Bangladesh in the last 3 years is significant investment behind innovation and significant marketing spends to diversify the portfolio. We have made small steps whether it's in hair dyes or -- but what we intend to do is a far more aggressive expansion of the portfolio and diversification of the portfolio notwithstanding the political uncertainty. Because at the end of the day, if the GDP growth is 3% or 4% or 4% and 5%, CPG players should grow. The CPG sector should grow to twice the GDP, and an aggressive player should grow more than that. So I think we have to take this in the stride and build it in the face of uncertainty of doing business in emerging markets. And we have to get that growth. So I think we will be in an investment mode in Bangladesh, and we will have a sharp innovation program unless something again significantly happens in the geopolitical space. In the last 1 month, things have been slightly more stable than what it was perhaps in the October, December quarter."

This brings me to the motivation behind our recent announcement of our agreement to acquire Vulcan Cyber. The acquisition of Vulcan will augment our existing data capabilities and accelerate our ability to deliver on the future of exposure management in two ways. First, it will enhance our ability to aggregate and consolidate vast amounts of data into a singular unified cyber risk data set within Tenable One. Specifically, Vulcan will allow us to integrate data from more than 100 third-party security products, such as end point security, cloud security, application security and vulnerability assessment. These extensive data aggregation capabilities, when combined with our own extensive risk data, will help customers consolidate all exposures across their security stack into a singular prioritized view from which they can remediate threats. By leveraging this unified risk data set, we believe Tenable will be positioned to advance AI-driven exposure management to transform how customers predict, prioritize and mitigate risk across the security stack."

I mean, we've reached a much lower level, which has been a deliberate policy by the British government to encourage PFI and not the landfills. So it's just a quarter. I don't draw any very significant conclusion from this. In terms of the PFI construction, everything is on end. As you know, we have about a 25% market share in those new incinerators. The way we account for -- and therefore, the program is starting to slow down. It will stop about 1 year, 1.5 years from now where we will have built our last large incinerator and, therefore, we will have no more construction revenue. This construction revenue is just the way we account for those investments, the way we have to account for those investments. It's not yet official because it carries no -- almost no margin and, therefore, no earnings. In terms of recyclates and energy prices, you really have to analyze this contract by contract. In many cases, we are not hedged for recyclates. Meaning, if recyclates go down, it's our loss. In some cases, we're able to pass it through to the customer or to reduce the price at which we would pay for inputs. But for recyclates, we tend to be exposed. For energy prices, again it varies from one country or 1 contract to the next, but we tend to be hedged, and we tend to be relatively indifferent."

Moving our business from the legacy products, which include transactional forms and labels, for example, to core solutions, which help customers maintain brand consistency, operate more efficiently, reduce security risks for example. It's not static. We must actively manage a variety of our products and solutions through the stages of their product life cycles. What that says is that there will always be a legacy in the core. But the definition will change as time goes on, things that are core today will become legacy and we'll replace them with new core things, which is why innovation is so terribly important in our business and why we've spent more money in the last 2 years on marketing, product management than we had in the previous 6 or 7. We continue to gain traction with existing customers around value added core solutions, as well as selling to new customers. We have a very robust activity underway to acquire new business through existing customers and expanding the relationship we have with existing businesses. This table, which you can see on this slide, which we've shown before, represents the differences, the contrast between legacy products and core solution and gives you an indication of how we're going to market, where the investments for the company are taking place and where our revenue expectations and predictability will come from."

Number 1, there are really no major department stores in Europe outside of El Corte Ingles in Spain, and I'm talking about Continental Europe. In the U.K., of course, there are large department stores and it's very similar business to the U.S. But in Europe, it's only Spain and, to some degree, Germany, not as important as in the United States. So it's harder to substitute the small type which is more prevalent in all of Europe when it comes to an Amazon, et cetera, et cetera. So we don't -- we see the same -- there's no question that the European e-commerce, as a matter of fact, in many cases, in some countries has a higher percentage of the market than in the United States. But it's a different situation, brands are still more important in Europe than in the United States. Although as a total, they represent a total -- a smaller percentage of the total market. And there is no question that we have some brands that have a lot of appeal to the Europeans, like Callaway, Nike and even Penguin and Farah is a good brand there from before. So we see Europe as a very fertile market for us to grow, and when I'm in Europe, I mean, all the countries in Europe, including the probably the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera."

So some of these -- the things that impact us, managing security policies using automation is one thing that happens to be what we do and shifting workloads to the cloud. I think also the crisis caused people to think more deeply about how they do things, including work, obviously. So the new environment unshackled a lot of mid-level managers and allowed them to implement changes that were unthinkable in some ways a few weeks ago. So in automation, obviously, there's a lot of efficiency gains from taking network change processes that took weeks and shrinking them down to minutes, and efficiency is more important right now in a resource-constrained environment. So security professionals have to deal with a lot of challenges from work from home that didn't exist before. But the efficiency gains from automation that have been clear for a long time. So what's happening right now is network security professionals are being empowered to think about how to implement new and better processes like automation.

First and foremost, there is the impact of those natural disasters and political upheaval that we’ve just got to continue to keep an eye on. Secondly, while there are a number of positive signs in the economy, we continue to watch the economy very carefully, given concerns that remain around unemployment and the housing market in the United States, and as Martina reminded you, around food and oil prices around the globe. And of course, we've got to keep working our way through the ultimate impact of this U.S. debit regulation, which will depend both on the final regulation, the outcome of the bill, what the Fed said and of the reactions of all the stakeholders. As we've said and as Martina said, we are going to continue to invest in our business.

As we've talked about in the past years, when you go around the globe, there are a various amount of competitors that are always smaller in nature and smaller in scale. But clearly, it is a opportunity for a lot of people to want to continue to play in. There's also larger enterprise customers that have greater scale than we do, which was also one of the reasons why we wanted to do the combination of the Danaher TekComms business and NetScout, was to be able to capitalize on that scale. So the competitive landscape is still probably relatively the same, differentiated by lower, smaller-scope regional geographical players to some of the very large infrastructure players who do it on a more broad but less quality way, and then NetScout, who is a pure-play player. Regarding some of the customers and the service provider customers who we are thinking about or trying to move into SDN and NFV, again, the combination of NetScout and Tektronix, we have a wealth of information that we feel in an area where people are moving into NFV, there are many opportunities for us to play with that information.

And it's both -- for 2 different reasons, we're faced with declining units in both of those categories, which is most of the driver behind it. In filtration, it's the extended drain interval changeovers, which takes units out of the category. And in filtration, it's due to better units or better pumps coming out of the OEs today than we've had in years past, which, again, drive units out of the category. So that puts pressure on pricing. And then in the fuel delivery category, we've got the additional pressure created by the low-cost country suppliers moving into that market as well. Are we through it? I don't think we're through it, but I think we're starting to level off. Certainly, leveling off more in filtration than fuel delivery at this point, I think.

We are, therefore, reaffirming our 2016 outlook and narrowing net revenues and adjusted EBITDA outlook ranges as follows: The net revenues range is reaffirmed and narrowed between $4.7 million and $4.9 billion; the adjusted EBITDA range is reaffirmed and narrowed between $485 million and $505 million; the negative impact of the depreciation of the British pound on adjusted EBITDA has been and will be offset by cost-containment initiatives and synergies."

More specifically to this point, as organizations accelerate their migration of applications and workloads to the cloud, we are finding that our people-centric approach to security is clearly resonating with both customers and prospects. While operating in the cloud has many well-known benefits, the move to the cloud also creates an entirely new set of attack vectors that threat actors are readily exploiting in their relentless efforts to compromise organizations, leaving companies with significant security blind spots, given that traditional on-premise security infrastructure, by definition, could not meet the challenges posed by this new generation of cloud systems and infrastructure. And in this new world of cloud applications and workloads, threat actors are keenly aware that it is far easier to target and compromise people as opposed to infrastructure in their efforts to infiltrate a company for financial gain. In fact, over 99% of all targeted attacks are designed to drive human interaction in order to achieve their objective, whether it is stealing login credentials, running malicious code, wiring money or exfiltrating sensitive and valuable data."

So if you are in a market that is experiencing a reduction in demand and you have investors underwriting future growth one way and owners believing differently, you might well have investors go, well, geez, why don't we just hold and either recap it or refinance it or do something else rather than sell it if we both believe it because I am equally concerned with reinvestment risk, if you give me my capital back and I'll redeploy it in a market where we're finding asset level priced fairly well depending upon, again, what area of the country you're in. So that could have an impact for some elongated holds. But again, these are 10-year finite life funds, and you do have this offset here with compensation metrics, Mitch, that we've talked about before on calls like this where you have your pref promote construct from a compensation standpoint there.

But I think it speaks to that there's a lot of activity on the IT side and there's a lot of catalyst in place for IT spending growth. Yes, the migration in the cloud, which is very good for us, you have all these companies trying to figure out big data, you have security issues, you have people trying to get their data on to mobile devices. So on the IT side, there's a lot of catalyst, there's a lot of activity and that's I think that's one of the reasons why the traffic is growing nicely in addition to that we're doing a good job with it and we're seeing a pull back. The missing piece, which I think is pretty clear when you look at the economic data that's being reported is, companies just are not in reinvestment mode. So for IT spending, you need 2 things, you need the catalyst, which I think we have in space. But then you also need companies to be -- have the confidence and optimism to be investing in themselves.

The allowance for credit losses increased by $2.6 billion this quarter, raising the bank's total allowance coverage of gross loans and acceptances from 74 basis points to 103 basis points. This increase is primarily due to higher-performing allowances, including the impact of credit migration, reflecting a significant deterioration in the economic outlook related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the mitigating impact of a variety of deferral and government assistance programs available to our clients. The change in the economic outlook incorporates a material increase in unemployment, substantial near-term GDP contraction and assumes a gradual recovery where economic activity does not return to pre crisis levels for an extended period. The allowance increase was across the Canadian and U.S. geographies and by asset class, due to a $1 billion increase for our business and government portfolios, reflected across multiple industries including oil and gas, and $1.6 billion increase across the consumer lending portfolios primarily for the auto, other personal and credit card portfolios. $438 million of the increase in the credit cards portfolios is attributable to the U.S. strategic card partner share. I'm satisfied with the bank's current allowance coverage considering the provisions added this quarter and our portfolio and geographic mix. The potential for further provisions will largely depend on the magnitude and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

As we've moved progressively opening stores every week, they continue to open at a higher base.

Geographically, it's been very interesting because there isn't really a geographical impact per se, but we do see that in order -- areas that were most impacted by COVID-19, the stores opened a little bit slower.

And so it had development pressure on it and the prices reflect that. In the state of Alabama, a similar dynamics in terms of pressure from development on a forest. On the private side, this was a private interest that actually had some conservation and other interest to it.

We achieved record quarterly revenue of $410 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year. Acquisition-related revenues and strong growth in industrial PPE were weighed down by lower sales of pandemic-related respiratory products. While SCBA and FGFD were down organically in the quarter, healthy orders and ongoing supply chain challenges drove backlog up in these areas.

It's a more steady-state business, in general terms, despite trends like the U.K. has started Black Friday sales and that kind of stuff. But in general, you don't have the spikes over promotion holidays. I would say, you have a very competitive environment period overall, and you got to work through mix and the other tools to, again, generate margins. So I think the strongest country seasonality you're seeing in Europe is still Russia, which had a very strong Q4 business. That's long historically. The other markets are reasonably balanced.

And then finally, I just wanted to ask, have you seen any traffic impact overall across any format or any country after you lowered personnel? How do you balance these SG&A reduction with obviously the, I guess, legacy that Cencosud has had in the past of very high service levels? So you think you're compromising that service level as you reduce headcount or not?"

Indications early in the second quarter pointed to the largest corn crop in history for North America, only to reverse sharply with the onset of extremely dry conditions.

When you convert that to Real, we have 2 exchange components. We have begin -- begun to see that more clearly, starting in Q2 2016. Despite the volatility in exchange rate. But when we compare these numbers, these margins should be more comparable when compared to last years. But again, it was a very strong impact. I mentioned at the start of my presentation, the devaluation level in several countries with no exception in Latin America. So that volatility impacts on both -- on 2 fronts.

Fortunately, on balance, we expect the new law to the extent we can ascertain how it will be applied, to be manageable for City National.

On the other side, U.S., Europe, I would say, semiconductor company were building CAT M, and they did the NB-IoT just only as a version of software without major change of the cost structure.

And from this point of view, definitely, we have a highway in front of us to be almost uniquely positioned if the Asian, they don't come to this market to serve the market with NB-IoT only.

The average unemployment rate in the 13 metropolitan areas rose from 10.8% in 2018 to 11.2% in 2019. Lack of enough job creation and the impact of the migration of millions of Venezuelans to this country seem to be the main causes for the resiliency in unemployment. It must be noted, however, that during January of this year, average unemployment in the 13 principal cities in the country saw improvement as it dropped year-on-year by 80 basis points, from 13.7% to 12.9%, the lowest there has been for the month of January in the last 5 years."

As you saw on Bayer's announcement last week, on a euro basis, Nexavar performance is actually meaningfully stronger, and we see here Q3 for example that we're at a position, where the dollar is still about 10% off from a headwind standpoint relative to what we saw in Q3 last year. In addition, we certainly look to the impact of the global macroeconomic conditions, and in particular, the way that has interfaced with healthcare reform. In Europe, in particular, we're seeing a strong level of pricing pressure in countries like Germany and in Spain. And globally, but really, initially felt here in the U.S., with increasing competition in the kidney cancer market. So we felt it was appropriate, given the results we've seen year-to-date against that backdrop to update our guidance here as we come into the fourth quarter."

Nevertheless, on balance, monetary policy in the U.S. and perhaps the U.K. will likely diverge in 2015 from the continued easing in both the eurozone and Japan. These economic divergences and uncertainties appear to have contributed to the return of volatility across assets. Geopolitical factors have also played their part. At the start of the third quarter, volatility across most financial markets was at historically low levels. Several central bankers voiced concern about this complacency as it potentially reflected the underpricing of risk. There is less cause for this concern now.

And it's an excellent project in a low political risk environment that's, other than that last permit, ready to go. And so we think that it's ready to move ahead and we look forward to it."

As you know, we started showing the backlog within these major market areas down the lower right-hand column.

I would say this market, I would characterize all of it as being good to strong, both -- and really on a geographical basis.

DME is stronger than we would have anticipated, even as we're coming into their summer. So no, the energy markets themselves have been quite robust and we would expect them to be robust going forward. I mean, the surprise, I think, has been DME, and the affordability has been better because of oil and higher propane. But also, propane is one of those products where it's got tariffs on it, significant tariffs coming into the country, which does impact the economics from PDH and using propane for straight heating and cooking. So we -- DME is a little better, but all the other demands are pretty well in line with what we thought they would develop."

Overall, our adjusted operating margin increased from 11.1% in Q4 of fiscal '19 to 12.3% in Q4 of fiscal '20 driven by both the Security and the Healthcare divisions. We were pleased with this margin expansion in the face of overall top line headwinds. The adjusted operating margin in our Security division improved to 15.5% compared to 13.5% in the prior year fourth quarter driven by sound operational execution and cost controls. Given increased revenues, our Healthcare division realized significant operating margin expansion from 13.1% in Q4 last year to 17.4% in Q4 of fiscal '20, representing the highest quarterly adjusted operating margin for this division in 5 years. These improvements were partially offset by a reduction in the adjusted operating margin in our Opto division to 10.8% compared to 11.9% in Q4 last year. It should be noted that although Opto saw a decrease in Q4, the full year adjusted operating margin in that division was a record 12.3%."

In the second half, it seems like you were, well, you said a sluggish sales at YRI, but yet the margins were up significantly in both operating and restaurants.

But if you want to grow faster, you got to grow -- you got to invest in the faster-growing segments. The other aspect of it is that Chris alluded to the fact that these things have been handicapped, risk-adjusted was his term, significantly. So we've taken that into consideration more heavily with the R&D than with the geographic thing because there's more uncertainty with the R&D frankly than the geographic aspect of it. The third thing you look at is the net effect of the new product sale not -- taking away the cannibalization aspect of it. Which is important given that we're #1 or #2 in 80% of our sales, there's going to be by design, a certain amount of cannibalization. So we put kind of heavier weight in those that would be less cannibalized, which would mean you'd be getting the same call points but more into some of the adjacent spaces and areas that would move the needle more than something where you'd cannibalize 90% of what you're in today.

I would describe the environment that we saw during the holidays as more uniform than we would typically expect it to be. But we were hearing a pretty similar refrain from our clients, that just seems to be more uniform pressure throughout the country because of reimbursement pressure and expense pressure. So yes, we've seen it, I would say it’s unusual for it to be quite so widespread. Having said that, there are also, in the fourth quarter you had -- you didn't have the expectation for the improving labor market that I think we now have. So I'm actually, I'm personally more optimistic about the business because fundamentally the environment is a better environment than the environment we entered last year with which ended up being a pretty good year.

And at the same time, as you well know, we still have a drag, basically, from a legacy celebrity fragrance business, which is a drag, basically, on the growth of the total company.

The market growth the company is exposed to is somewhere around 2%, since we're mostly an established markets business in terms of segments and countries we're exposed to. Market growth rate is slightly ahead of 2%. And clearly, we need to be, at some point in time, to grow at least in line with the market, but it will take time.

For Q4 '14, we expect SAN revenue to be in the range of down 1% to up 2% quarter-to-quarter. Typically, we see stronger buying patterns from our OEM partners in our fiscal Q4. However, we consider the potential impact of the geopolitical environment in certain emerging markets and the business transitions that we see within certain of our OEM partners as we set our outlook. For the full year 2014, we expect that SAN revenue will be up 1% to 2% on an adjusted basis. That would be at the low end of the 2-year target model we provided last September. We will be updating our 2-year target model at our upcoming Investor Day on September 24."

And to your point, there's some markets where there are various levels of security appropriate. And we will be more flexible about that going forward and match the security with the threat, and we believe there's opportunity for us there to be more efficient and cost-effective across the board.

Winning projects were determined based on customer value proposition and project impact, grid services, financial model, ownership model, safety and security as well as technology. Maxwell's project to provide ultracapacitors to ABB, the global leader in power and automation solution, allows Philadelphia area rail lines to be more energy efficient by recuperating braking energy and creates a revenue stream for the operator through the sale of excess energy to the regional grid operator. The project earned the ESNA Innovation Award in the mobility project category. And today, we issued a press release announcing that Corning and Maxwell have signed a joint development and supply agreement to advance the state of ultracapacitor materials and cell designs. Through  this collaboration we intend to tackle challenges frequently cited by our ultracapacitor customers, including energy density, lifetime operating environment, form factor and costs. We believe that Corning's expertise in  high-performance materials, analytical capabilities and technology innovations, coupled with Maxwell's expertise in ultracapacitor technology, product design and manufacturing processes will enable us to deliver superior product value for customers and end users. Additionally, Corning's long history of serving the transportation industry with emissions control products for automotive and heavy-duty truck market will complement Maxwell's growing presence in providing energy storage solutions for these markets. Obviously, joining forces with a company of Corning's quality and strength is a very significant step for Maxwell and its future."

We've actually seen the Brazilian real improve against the U.S. dollar in the third quarter, which was unexpected quite frankly. But in addition to that, we've seen the business environment also improved, so that was a positive. In Argentina, we've seen the new administration implement actions to begin reducing the inflation and restoring confidence in that country. Argentina has seen huge cash inflows as investors look for debt that has actually real returns. So the inflation is still high. But the devaluation is less, so the improvement in U.S. dollars is continuing to improve. Mexico, I don't think we've seen a degradation at all. I don't think we've also seen the improvement. But seasonality, as I mentioned in my comments, is a factor for a lot of our Latin American countries as the fourth quarter contains the holiday seasons, where there is more cash movement. So we do recognize that the fourth quarter does represent a step up from the strong performance in the third quarter.

There's a price list for extended fiber our cable cell shop declined driven by local suppliers. This has led to a general market perception that the pricing structure of this industry has disrupted, and it would affect all the players globally to the same intensity. I would like to clarify that we see this development as more localized to a particular geography. And while it has some little effect on the global pricing, we do not see this disrupting our financial profile in this business. So a mix of higher volumes, higher value-added products with better utilization and our ongoing cost reserves, we are confident our profit growth and our product businesses next year and even the following years."

A significant portion of this increase is attributable to the contributions from the group's cruise port operations. Tension in the East Med and the attempted coup in July 15 had a massive impact on Turkey's overall cruise performance so far this year where the decrease in cruise passengers reached 65%. However, our ports operated by GPH were limited only to 39, thanks to the world-class security measures, utmost priority in our ports and unique excursion choices of Ege Ports and particular offers. As you know, GPH has a well-diversified cruise port network. And as a result of this, GPH ports, excluding Turkey, managed to increase cruise passengers by 26.6% year-on-year in 9 months 2016. And this increase was mainly driven by Barcelona, Malaga, Valetta and Singapore. Even Turkey is included. Total passenger base still indicates a satisfactory 10% increase, which is inorganic growth in 9 months 2016. Similarly, cruise revenues and EBITDA recorded 15.4% and 5.9% increase in 9 months 2016."

And clearly, at that time, we had in mind that we wanted to grow our Integrated Oxides, which was then called olefins, into a much larger business. As the year progressed, our understanding of this business improved. But at the same time, this was a very large transaction for IVL. We have never made a transaction of more than $1 billion. So when this transaction was being discussed, it was something that we were very concerned with, that is from all the trade wars point of view, from the global macro standpoint, are we doing the right thing by making this large bet on this particular business? So it took us longer than it would normally take us to make a decision. But then, we looked at all the boxes that we needed to cross. And as we went about with our due diligence, understanding our businesses, understanding the synergy with our existing business, we could check every box. What we got over here was a very competitive asset out of the Gulf Coast where the raw material costs are the cheapest.

But the biggest issue we would face as a total return vehicle would be the repatriation of cash generated offshore, without subjecting it to undue taxation. In terms of the type of opportunities that might be worth looking at, it seems reasonable that we might extend one or more of our existing lines of business into a new jurisdiction. For example, we might consider bulk liquid terminals in Canada or Mexico. We already have partial interest of 2 terminals in Canada with IMTT, or we could consider Contracted Power & Energy projects in either of those jurisdictions, both approximate, stable and known quantities from a political and regulatory perspective. And given the tax treaties in place among the 3 countries, repatriating cash would not be a particular concern. We would have to get comfortable with the risks, but if the returns were appropriate I don't want to rule it out. And thanks to those of you who have asked the question and made us think about these issues. I've made more of the growth backlog in our ability to execute on additional deployment than usual.

The first half of 2014, severely hit by the political uncertainty, and this also impacted the overall economy. Consumer confidence, still relatively low and leading to still slow consumption and customer spending. We see that basically the poor people have limited ability to spend, limited spending power, while the middle class, high class have still not fully recovered their confidence about the future. And the private debt situation is still a concern. Overall, immediately after the military intervention [ph], we saw some improvement. This was probably related to some pent-up demand that's now covered. And you now see the consumptions in the third quarter still being slow. And we're waiting for the recovery of the economy. However, we see that the fiscal situation is fairly solid, so we do expect that the economy will recover. But it's a question about the timing. And we see the analysts following the macro economy have revised down the expectation for the year. On competition, still very competitive. The main driver being the migration to 3G.

And number two, there are the security concerns, which require some swaps. And to mitigate full-scale swaps, we have come up with a technology approach to do it with a light LTE layer and then connect that to non-standalone architecture for 5G. China and this thing about is that a reaction? No. We saw it similarly in 4G. I think the only difference is volume-wise China is going to be much bigger in 5G, it's an industrial policy. And of course we'll play. We expect to play, but we need to be very sensible about how we play. There's no point playing just for top line and volume. That is not the business we're in.

But also, that we find a way to make products like this available in a way that hopefully deters abuse going forward. So we also know that neither has come out and made a strong statement that they believe ADF's are part of the cutting-edge research that everybody is calling on. And obviously, we find ourselves in a place and time where there is a need for potent pain medications that don't have as high and abuse liability, and I think here at Egalet we completely agree with that and support that.

The European countries that subsidize demand to enable the solar industry to scale to present level have been reducing their subsidies. In the U.S., there have been no significant new state-level solar programs in several years. And with solar industries feeding mostly off of legacy subsidies in California. At the same time, supply chain entry barriers for silicon have evaporated, leading to massive capacity buildup. Excess supply relative to demand has led to pricing and margin reduction because demand in the short-term is inelastic, and by that, I mean lower prices might enable a company to take more share with declining subsidy pool, but they won't increase aggregate demand. Because of that, returns on capital have also declined."

But if you took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I think the third quarter was up 6%, the fourth quarter was up 73%. You get to around -- you get north of 30% for sure and they've been chugging right along. The U.S. commercial team is doing extremely well, particularly penetrating new channels and developing those new channels, broadening out those new channels. All of that's adding to the U.S. growth. Europe as you know has been challenged a little bit, particularly Southern Europe, but even some of the bigger countries with the sovereign debt issues that are going on over there and some of the uncertainty, so we've probably been a little cautious in that area.

It gives us the consistency that we're looking for. I also think that the value to the customer, as we put a nicer product out there with a little bit more upgrade fit and finish, and our average sales price now consistently over $200,000, I guess shows the value to the customers, especially the more qualified customers and gives us a lot of consistency across the country. In the existing communities, so we've been cautious not to promote the new package too much, because we do want to sell out of our existing inventory, but we are starting to see results where the communities that are selling both of the packages, certainly the customers are willing to pay a premium price, which is going to help our margins to have that upgraded fit and finish."

That is why it is significant for us to be able to work together with game software vendors. And then we can combine that with mobile security and the vendor's application check can be done with our basic functionalities, so we can do the recommendation together. In other words, the users will be able to use the game software with confidence. And then, of course, payment will be done and payment settlement is different from one country to another so we'll work together with a settlement company to -- it's revenue share among 3 parties.

And another additional major element is the positive contribution of administrative measures and operational efforts, which reflect an improvement of variable costs at EUR 16 million but also lower production costs and better overheads at EUR 6.1 million. So the group's operating margin remains solid at 13.3% over the first 9 month or nearly the same level that we had in the first half of the year.

Through this program, customers that purchase certain physical Barracuda next-generation firewalls and Web Application Firewall products receive a free 90-day cloud license of the same product for use in both Microsoft Azure and AWS. This program enables customers to begin utilizing the cloud with new or existing workloads without having to worry about how or where they will deploy their security resources."

And what we're going to do is take some of the efforts that we've been implementing in the U.S. and spread them around the globe to some of our larger countries to allow us to get the synergies and scale of the investment we made in the U.S. So in a perfect world, what we'll be taking successfully implemented projects in the U.S. and translating that capability into our other large countries. Once we then have the large countries covered, then we can roll into smaller countries and get the benefits there as well.

Because the services that Infoblox manages reside at the core of the network, we collect highly valuable data. Our new reporting and analytics enhancement mines this data to provide actionable intelligence that can alleviate networking pain points around capacity planning, application uptime, security and compliance issues. Users can create custom reports and dashboards, which can tell them what already happened and, more importantly, can help them predict what will happen on the network. For example, they can forecast network growth and peak usage times, giving the administrator critical information to stay ahead of the curve, which can lead to fewer outages and better application performance."

Nevertheless, the U.S.A. has announced an import waiver at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 for 8 countries. For instance, China, India, South Korea, et cetera. They are all major importers of oil from Iran, causing the oil price in the fourth quarter of 2018 to soften due to lessened impact of the sanctions. Meanwhile, in the third quarter of 2018, the economic and inflation crisis in Venezuela have caused a modest supply to drop, which has contributed to an increase in oil price and, subsequently, the stock gain of USD 1.2 per barrel."

Operating margins expanded nearly 1 percentage point to 7.7%.

That led us to exit the contracting markets in several countries and we instead became a manufacturing supplier in those markets at higher margins. That strategic shift is working, as evidenced by a 38% increase in third-party tube sales in 2011 at much more attractive manufacturing margins.

And when you look at projections, actually it's, of course, not unexpected, they're very different depending on the geographical zones.

TPS' revenue increased to $388.9 million from $372.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in our Retail Communications, and to a lesser extent, in our payment services verticals. Third quarter revenue was $13.8 million less than the prior quarter's revenue of $402.8 million, a 3.4% decline. The decrease was entirely attributable to a decrease in wholesale termination revenues. We attribute the sequential decline in wholesale termination revenue partly to 3 fewer days in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, the holidays in the second quarter and partly to increasing permit [ph] international long-distance termination rates in several key calling corridors. These rate increases impacted the entire industry, leading to a reduction in Wholesale Carrier minutes that IDT sells and transports, and a decline in revenue even as we increased our revenue per minute. Although minutes of use and revenue were down as a result, these wholesale markets shifts were generally related to a very low margin country destinations, and thus, the impact of these rate increases on operating profit is expected to be neutral to positive. Overall, our wholesale terminations vertical generated $159.3 million in revenue in the third quarter, compared to $179.8 million in the year-ago quarter, and $182.2 million in the prior quarter."

So that will be less effect if, let's say, there's a hike in the cost of funding in FX."

After adjusting for these losses, our Insurance current accident year loss ratio was slightly higher by 0.04, notwithstanding significant pretax losses of $40 million in our Marine book, driven by the impact of large industry offshore energy loss events. This resulted in the Marine reported current year loss ratio being significantly higher than it's historical average. While this line of business can, from time to time, be exposed to significant loss events, I would like to point out that this line of business has been historically very profitable for our company. The segment also reported a higher loss ratio in the credit and political risk lines, reflecting a cautious stance we've taken in the face of current geopolitical and economic uncertainties, primarily in Europe. This compared adversely to a very low loss ratio for this line of business in the second quarter of 2014, due to the absence of any known loss circumstances. These increases in current year loss ratio were almost fully offset by the significant improvement in the midsize loss experience in our property lines, as well as continued loss ratio improvement in our professional lines, following a significant effort aimed at reshaping this book over the last 18 months."

While at the same time, it is important to continue investing in the strategic priorities that we've outlined in the business.

I will start with Missiles and Fire Control, who passed an important milestone on a prospective new business opportunity. Our tactical missiles team successfully tested its next-generation long-range precision missile for the U.S. Army's Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, competition. The Missiles and Fire Control team launched PrSM from the Lockheed Martin High Mobility Artillery Rocket, or HIMARS system, successfully demonstrating accuracy and range of flight, validating HIMARS' interfaces and testing system software performance. We are excited by the prospects of this enhanced surface-to-surface system and look forward to building on our long-running army tactical missile system legacy as we progress through the upcoming procurement decision."

We have an ongoing analysis of all of the MSAs where we've got more than 5% -- well, there's 2 versions of it. So there's 3% to 5% and then greater than 5% employment in the energy industry. And we're looking at all of our consumer and commercial exposures in those geographical areas to measure impact and to think about how we lend money, a, what our balance sheet exposure is; and b, what our new origination exposure looks like. And it would -- it might surprise you that places like Houston, because of their relative diversity of their overall economy, are actually performing relatively stronger than some counties in -- that represent other basins in the Dakotas, in the West, et cetera. But we really haven't seen any second-order big impact yet among any of them in terms of our balance sheet exposure. And we've got -- we're on the lookout. The entire credit organization here is focused on how that might change, but it really hasn't yet. And then as John mentioned earlier, for most of our customers, 98% of our loans and most of our retail consumer-customers and our wholesale customers, lower fuel costs mean lower transportation costs, mean lower heating costs, mean lower power costs. It's not bad for their business. They're impacted if their customers are employed in the business. They're impacted if they're selling into the business, but it's got a net stimulative effect. And so we haven't seen a big spillover yet."

I would say as MiFID II comes into effect on January 1, I think the industry is still trying to grapple with exactly what needs to be done and how we're actually going to comply with the regulation. And frankly, given the various differences in regulations around the world, trying to get some harmonization across geographies so that we can ensure that we are in compliance in multiple geographies. So a little unclear as we sit here today. What I would say is when you say material, I don't think it will be materially detrimental to the industry, but it's not clear exactly what -- how the research cost will actually get paid. The mechanism today is that we do it through a commission-sharing agreement. It's going to -- the regulators in Europe are going to make us specifically set it by client, set aside money and accounts where it will be very transparent what we're paying for research. So I think the challenge in the industry longer time is whether we move away from soft dollars, and the industry has to actually take this cost on their income statement over time. Again, not clear at the moment. The regulators are going to have to provide a lot of clarity. But I don't think, at the end, it will be material to margins, but it will have some detrimental impact on margins."

And it is the geographies we operate in. We're not in states where there is a lot of pressure on increasing the hourly wage -- the minimum hourly wage. And as we've noted before, we really don't have very many minimum-wage employees. We feel like we compensate them fairly. And I think, for 2017, I've included in my projections, something like a 2.5% increase in labor, so a little more than we head in 2016. We had 1.9% increase, as I noted, for the full year of 2016.

Then I think that is very reasonable. I think the markets consensus probably, I think, is little less than 1%. The team of Bradesco is 1.5%, but the market consensus around 1%. Then we see slightly reasonable effect, but we need to have the GDP positive in 2017."

As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit for the region was 4%. Unlike Mexico, which has a 7% trade surplus, the situation in Central America reduces the risks of protectionist policies from Washington. The only country in the region with a trade surplus with the United States is Nicaragua, but their exports are primarily raw materials in the form of textiles, coffee, gold and meat.

This is one of our automotive segments that has a global footprint and specializes in providing underhood and underbody engineered thermal solutions for vehicles. During the fourth quarter, total sales were $38.5 million, a decline of 7.2% from Q4 2013. Despite an absolute decrease in total segment sales, the underlying growth trends in this business remain largely positive. Organic growth was 4.9%, which was offset by lower tooling revenue of 7.3% and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 4.8%. From a geographic standpoint, we experienced mid-single-digit growth in both North America and Europe, which was good to see as we continue to monitor the European economy. For the full year, segment level sales increased 3.7% to $164.3 million, driven mostly by organic growth of 5.8%, offset by declining tooling revenue of 2.1%. We also continued efforts to get our China facility back on track and meeting our expectations as a business. As we have previously shared, the business fell behind schedule, mostly due to customer delays in program launches. In addition, this past quarter, we experienced some material sourcing and qualification issues, which have since been resolved. We still expect this facility to be a breakeven operation at some point in the second half of 2015, and continue to believe in its long-term viability. The material sourcing issue negatively impacted segment margin in the quarter by approximately 330 basis points and 140 basis points on a full year basis."

But outside of that, from some of the other things that we've heard some folks say and how long is the -- well as the fact that if you think the economy's slowly going to recover we think that we could see a decent uptick. So just curious if this is really just sort of a shipping days issue or whether there's anything that geographically things look maybe a little bit different for you guys, or if you guys are just trying to be conservative because it's sort of tough to know how things are going to shake out?"

We were not lucky because first of all, we have some operations that didn't have the efficiency that we were expecting. And second, we had some weather issues as well in the northern part of the country that also affected us. So it was a combination of the pricing, the weather and also the activation of those fleets. And the instructions to our operational groups and also to our managers is to basically not to lose money. This is the most important piece. But I don't think we managed to do that in the U.S. in the quarter. And that we don't feel very happy about it. And I have to tell you that the only positive about this is that we see an environment that is constructive, is more positive. And the pricing is basically taking us to a better level that is going to start happening in the -- as we speak because it's moving, is a dynamic situation. And we will have those 2 fleets already in business, which is basically something that is going to help our positioning. But are we going to bring more fleets with the same situation? I would say no. If pricing doesn't really get to the level where it has to be."

Crude oil price will be dependent on the success or failure of the OPEC and non-OPEC alliance, political tension as well as demand/supply balance. Nevertheless, global oil demand is still expected to grow in 2019, and this is expected to lend some support with stabilization of crude oil price. And amid of all these factors, GDP have declined slightly in first quarter 2019, but in Asia Pacific region demand fundamentals remain solid, as the petrochemical deficit is expected to grow in the region over the next few years by a bit more [indiscernible]."

The first part, we would expect demand to recover over time, particularly -- I think it's a little harder to call the in-Japan demand because of all the disruption in the country. We would expect that's going to take longer. So the cars that aren't sold there in the second half of our fiscal year, I think that'll take longer to come back. But we would expect, much like we saw after the big downturn 2 years ago in the Auto industry, the pent-up demand is pretty resilient and comes back pretty fast if the production's there. So I would -- if we lose 3 million cars in the second half of this year, we'd expect to get 2/3 of that back in the first half of next year. I mean, that's I think what the experts are saying. And we, talking to our customers, that's what we would expect. I think you could expect the margin flow through of similar on the upside because we're not going to lay in any extra cost. So what's really happening now as the volume goes down, we're not taking people out of the factories in Japan for obvious reason and as it comes back, we wouldn't expect we're going to need extra -- lay in extra variable cost to meet the volume. So I would expect a similar flow through on the rebound."

Looking at, for example, Asia here, then normally in Q2, you have about 1.5 million barrels per day of capacity out. Now you're almost double. So the facts show that refiners will be coming back, or they're out now and obviously then will be coming back. In addition, you've got more refinery capacity coming on in '19 and '20 than seen -- we probably haven't seen in the world. So that factor, I think, is huge. When it comes to the chartering activity, we're seeing more activity now in the Middle East given the political unrest, and people will probably want their barrels out quicker. But the overhang of tonnage is not there to move the rates yet, but we're obviously watching that space closely. And I think the -- want to really watch closely is what's happening in the Atlantic. So I expect the volumes in the Atlantic, in June and July, to be a lot, lot higher than what we've seen recently.

I'd say we've intentionally wanted to change the mix of the company to a source of sales and profit, et cetera, that wasn't necessarily as reliant on government reimbursement. We wanted a greater mix of patient pay or consumer pay. And I'd rather ride with the consumer markets than ride with the volatility of, say, a Europe, where it's heavily, heavily reimbursement-driven. And given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces, you're at the whim of the next stroke of the pen to cut prices. So we wanted a different mix, and we wanted a different geographic mix. We wanted a different balance in how much we're reliant on payers, how much we're reliant on governments and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the patient themselves. So that drove some of the choice around geography and/or business areas that we believe make up a durable growth company. We also find that the predictable growth and profitability of countries that are -- or businesses that are more patient pay is, frankly, more reliable than those that, at least for us, are susceptible to reimbursement cuts, et cetera. So it doesn't mean we don't want to be in countries that are reimbursement-driven. We do. It's a matter of balance. It's a matter of mix. It's a matter of trying to have it all but not too much."

And obviously, those trends are heavily influencing us. So we see commodity price increases there with some of the key suppliers for ceramic capacitors, resistors, silicon chips and so forth. So that is creeping into the system. As I mentioned earlier on, as a reply to a previous questions, as we do the majority of the business with OEMs, we are obviously embedded into firm pricing arrangements over certain period of time, so we have no opportunity to pass on these commodity price increases to the customer base. Having said all that, we are negotiating on an ongoing basis with our suppliers in order to secure, first of all, supply -- steady supply, because in this type of booming environment, it's not always guaranteed that supply is adequate.

It also has, for consequences, to increase the premium cession rate.

Today, with cybersecurity, and this is really what's driving, it was cybersecurity threats for hospitals, the IT departments were under more of a microscope and more pressure to make sure that devices aren't added as networks that are going to create a security threat, and so they're involved. Most of our devices in neurodiagnostics do connect to hospital's network, and so IT gets involved to understand what those interactions are or what systems we're using and what security [ threats ] just might be in there. So we've added to the team of expertise for the sales teams to be able to answer and address those questions as well as we've added things to products in terms of security patches and security features to help us be more competitive and better meet customer needs in that area of requirements."

We estimate that Shack sales were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million due to nationwide protests and resulting curfews causing temporary Shack closures and reduced operating hours during the 2-week period from May 28 to June 10. Same-Shack sales declined approximately 49% in the second quarter compared to the prior year driven by a decline in traffic of 60.1% and an increase in price/mix of 11.1%. The increase in price/mix was driven by a 28% increase in our average check as a result of the significant shift into digital channels we've seen over the last few months, which have historically carried a higher average check than in Shack. In terms of sequential progression of same-Shack sales throughout the quarter, we were encouraged with the continued improvement with year-on-year declines of 64% and 42% for fiscal April and May, respectively, and 39% in fiscal June when adjusting for the impact of the protest. Including the impact of the protest, same-Shack sales reflect a decline of 42% in fiscal June. Same-Shack sales in fiscal July were down 39%, while delivering a further sequential increase in average weekly sales in the period, all of which can be seen on Page 7 of our supplemental materials."

And as we think about upstream in the segments of drilling, completion and ongoing production, it's really upstream and a lot of ongoing production. And so if we look at rig count and activity that is going on in the Permian, and some of the other deposits are placed, but really the Permian, there's good activity. And as wells go from free flow which we have participation to artificial lift and requiring parts and components or mechanical to do that, that's good for our business. And really, through the activity and change in oil price from 60s to, I believe, it's around $52 now. A lot of those producers, I mean, they worked well on their breakeven point. So our view is that continues at its rate or activity in those geographies, and if we look ahead at what's been drilled and not completed, there's a lot that can or will come online at some point. Now, hey, does global demand play into that? Does the supply play into that? But I think, supply is what, 8% above its 5-year average, doesn't seem to be having a slow down effect right now, especially in that geography given its take away to the refineries. So that's what's driving our view. Of course, there's discussions with customers and producers in that, but that's what's driving our view that the -- our second half is a lot like our first half, maybe perhaps with the potential to be a little bit better."

That's not nearly as important, and it probably -- that probably should be customized for the unique geology or geography of that subsea development. What's really critical and what makes the difference in terms of cost, lead time and reliability is those key components. The tree, the manifold, the technology, the connection system, the controls, this is what's critical to be standardized, and that's what the partnership with the 4 operators is geared towards standardizing. The actual configuration of the field, how the equipment will be positioned in the field, that will vary field-by-field."

Obviously, we set our assumptions at the end of the year and with 2 months to go, we may likely see continued volatility given the political U.S. budget and global macroeconomic conditions. However, as I look at the pension picture today, absent any changes to our method of accounting, we estimate that our noncash pension expense or FAS expense could more than double in 2013 compared with our current view of 2012, which is in the $30 million to $40 million range."

Given these near-term dynamics and then our Mid-Con assets are 99% held by production, which preserves the tenor of our development options, we have concluded our drilling program, with the remaining operator wells coming online later this month. We will continue to monitor commodity price dynamics and maintain flexibility to adjust as may be warranted.

Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million."

Natural gas prices remain low, high regional crude price differentials were cutting into Canadian oil producers' revenues, political uncertainties surrounded the crucial Keystone XL and Northern Gateway oil export pipeline projects and many producers' share prices were weak. Yet Pulse went on to deliver a record year and entered a new year in 2013 with optimism and confidence. The reasons are mainly twofold. First, Pulse's finances, already strong entering 2012, had been lifted to a new level. This year, we will continue to adjust our spending in pursuit of those initiatives that we think will generate the highest returns for our stakeholders. From here, we have the option to go further after participation survey opportunities to make data set acquisitions, to continue repurchasing Pulse shares on the open market and to pay down additional debt.

And that channel is becoming more confident in selling product on their own, and we're seeing that actually quarter-by-quarter. So the channel is becoming more educated, is able to produce more business with less effort from us. But it's still quite a technical sale, so we still get involved in quite a lot, if not most of the channel deals. I think the opportunity for early leverage for the channel will come out of the security kind of products that we just announced. I would say more than half of their channel have a security practice as well, and so they understand the security market extremely well. And in talking to a few channel partners when we launched the 2 security products, there was a lot of interest around how they would use that to take their existing customer base and provide a more complete security solution and a better-managed security solution. So I think we are likely to see channel leverage come more quickly in the new products we're introducing because they have a security practice today and they have a customer base that they sold security products too and they understand it much better."

So we're somewhere in between advanced prototypes and LREP at this point, and capable of delivering and supporting initial quantities. And to the degree that, that might affect margins, I think we would just refer back to our guidance, that our revenue and our EPS guidance would anticipate everything we think is likely to happen this year."

In fact, on the hosted payload side, I'd say we were really the pioneer in that and have been working that for years and have enjoyed some success, but we look for more. In terms of long-term procurements and being strategic and looking how we can augment the MILSAT programs, that's one where we also have done some good early work and that have led -- has led to some RPs that are now available that we're bidding on. So I will just say, from a personal standpoint, I spend a lot of time lobbying Congress to ensure that we can look at long -- or allow longer-term procurements, just as our commercial customers enjoy. This way, we could be strategic, we can customize capacity as needed and we ultimately can offer better pricing, which is good for the American taxpayer. And actually, better for us because then we can plan long term and have the visibility that we are seeking. So I think we have done a great deal as a company. We're working, of course, as an industry, to do everything possible to change the dynamics for our military customers. So in the disaggregated systems, we are well positioned to take advantage of that. And on the Epic side, we think we have a much better performance for them to enjoy on our assets with the 10x better throughput and up to 3x to 5x better capacity we offer on the Epic satellites.

We are hoping to take it up in a significant way with this new line of switches, which we think is much more competitive.

In terms of the E-Rate deferrals, so I have not -- I'm not aware of people -- of projects that we have won where people are saying, \"Hey, I'm going to wait and defer.\" I did see there was one, I think, Ruckus talked about in their Q4 earnings call where they missed $1 million. That was a big order that didn't happen. That one, the customer did decide to cancel that and rebid it. So that one pushed out to a year. That -- we're actually competing for that one now.

But we are adding in new areas where we have real opportunity. So it's a portfolio approach of adding less mature opportunities into a group of countries that may be getting more mature. So net-net, you have to -- it's not clear that it would even be the right strategy to say that our average margin would go up internationally because that would signal that we're not finding new markets to actually go into and eventually build a market-leading position.

You will have to actually get the inside information in each of the region who actually are the good ones. And some of the people there in that segment are not worried about reputation versus those borrowers in the Corporate Banking segments.  So some of the principles in terms of lending practices have to be very different. And it will take time for us also to change their value system, their mindset, aligning the risk appetite across the 130 commercial banking centers across the country, while we want them to be also not moving from one end of being too broad to be very conservative as well.

So traditional alerting, traditional visibility tools that assume a small number of servers to kind of stay in place aren't well suited to the needs of today's enterprise customer. But what's an even bigger point of differentiation for New Relic Infrastructure is tracking in real-time the state and configuration across all those servers. Imagine, as many of our customers do, if a serious security flaw was exposed by an open source package, New Relic Infrastructure will allow our customers to search across tens of thousands of servers and instantly see where that faulty piece of software might be installed. We also track changes in real-time. And what we found out from our customers is that the #1 risk to production availability is a change.

But all in all, in Australia, we're entering the year in a pretty -- pretty confidently because transportation backlog has never been better, and we're seeing good opportunities in the buildings and properties side.

So many of the big consumer products companies called that out, in their -- in their conference calls for their Q3 numbers that they've seen this bid slowdown, particularly in China. And then, retailers have responded to that by cutting inventory, and so shipments really sort of came to a screeching halt over the summer months. So it was quite sudden and quite dramatic, but we wouldn't expect there to be a long-term degradation in the demand for a product like shampoo in a country of the size of China. But clearly, short term it's had quite an impact. So in a country with retailers are very disparate, very varied and very regional, it's kind of hard for our customers to read when things will bounce back, but I suspect most of them do, but it's still kind of alarming to them when that happens as suddenly as that.

There were a lot of shifts and it may -- this is very, very typical of first quarter where you have extreme volatility week to week. Some of it was calendar-driven, Valentine's Day flips off a weekend and into a -- and flips into the middle of the week, and that was a little bit of a headwind. Calendar-wise, spring break, Easter, all that shifting out in general, is not good for us. So having a time, spring break at a time where it's more likely that people would be both able and want to spend time outside. Again, so April spring break as opposed to March spring break is unbalanced or, on average, not right for us. So those are a couple of kind of things that created such headwinds. It's almost impossible to read any underlying trend by virtue of when the spring breaks are moving back and forth between March and April. And then the last thing I'd say is, on weather, we view it as a slight positive. We had a lot of rain in California, which is typically good for us, offset by some other regional issues around the country. So kind of net-net, we look at the entire thing and say it's not -- it's probably not a material impact to us since it all fell within our quarter."

The back-to-school season, for sure, looks dramatically different this year. The uncertainty around school starts and the shift to distance learning across much of the country has certainly had an impact on the traditional back-to-school purchases, resulting in a sales peak that's much lower than the same period last year. As we progress throughout the third quarter -- or through the third quarter, we're finding that the regions where school arrangements have been determined, they've seen nice improvements post-peak. While conversely, markets where plans have not been finalized have experienced declines."

From an organizational standpoint, we have created a new major market structure, under which 4 of our senior operating executives are reporting directly to Bob Pittman and myself. This major market's operating group will collaborate directly with our local market management to oversee our operations in our largest and highest revenue-generating markets from our core broadcast radio stations to our digital, mobile and events business, as well as a more expanded coordination with Clear Channel Outdoor. This puts the right structure in place to leverage our position efficiently and effectively as the country's leading, multi-platform Media and Entertainment company.

With this release, we can address majority of the problems sold by vendors of a higher price and more complex solutions like Infoblox and BlueCat Networks. New licensed sales growth for SolarWinds' IP Address Manager was much higher than our company average for the first quarter. In addition, for the first quarter in quite some time, our network tools product portfolio experienced an improvement in commercial market growth of the first quarter of 2013. We attribute this growth to the focus we have placed on creating a new marketing and sales approach for these individual-use products, which generally sell for less than $1,500. We also continue to see solid growth in new license sales for our Log & Event Management product in the first quarter, particularly in North America.

We're also going to provide a little bit more visibility into our international operations going forward because of this. With regard to the opportunities, I think you used the word correctly. it's going to be more opportunistic. We're not really looking at growing that business significantly. We're looking for opportunities with the good clients we have in those areas to potentially sell some additional services. But, we're doing that very cautiously. We want to understand the clients, understand the cultures in those countries, understand what those opportunities mean to us and risks associated with it. So we're really looking at this as a good opportunity for ourselves to sort of dip our toe in the international waters and get a better feel for what it means working internationally. So certainly, it's going to be front and center of our mind but certainly not a huge focus on growing that practice significantly.

Water segment revenues increased 2.5% in the second quarter to $102.4 million, with segment profit declining more than 50% year-over-year to $4.9 million. Water segment profit margin declined about 590 basis points year-over-year to 4.8%. As we saw in the first quarter of 2011, water segment revenues showed continued weakness in North America and the Middle East, where we had large projects in full swing in 2010. This was offset by revenue growth invested in Europe and Oceania. This year, there's a huge change in geographic mix, and as Simon described, the commodity pressures and discreet items in Q2 compressed our water margin in the second quarter. These discreet items include an inventory write-off and an unexpected charge we took for a project. However, the underlying performance of our water business and the discreet nature of our charges in Q2 provide confidence that the water segment margin will rebound quickly."

While some of our Enterprise customers are clearly feeling the macroeconomic pressure caused by the coronavirus pandemic, we estimate that only 13% of our current monthly recurring revenue is coming from what we would consider to be high-risk segments, such as retail, hospitality and the leisure industries. To proactively combat any pressure, we have implemented a renewal offer program for Enterprise customers that provides service credits upon contract renewal. To date, we have seen negligible impacts on collections.

A significant implication of this security mandate is a direct correlation in the inherent risk, as the number of vendors connected in an unbundled workers' compensation managed care model increase. Workers' comp claims environments grew out of the very early entry of property casualty insurers into the first workers' comp laws. As the industry evolved, new forms of managed care developed.

Likewise, if you are operating a corporate-wide area network to protect your data and ensure application performance, you still need this network capability when your application is hosted in the cloud infrastructure. SAVVIS can meet both of these needs. We have a benefit of 31 global data centers spanning North America, Europe and Asia.

And while we achieved record results and grew total adjusted EBITDA by 9%, the challenge we face is that we had targeted and expected even better numbers. Demand was a little weaker than we had originally anticipated, particularly in our International segment, where security issues and concerns impacted the summer peak. In this context, we took immediate steps to adjust our European fleet size and to respond to the competitive pressures that emerged and negatively impacted our realized pricing in Europe. As a result, as you saw in last night's release, we've reduced our full year earnings estimate to be at approximately the low end of our previous estimate of $850 million to $900 million of EBITDA. In a year that has seen significantly negative first quarter pricing, fleet cost pressures and an unstable geopolitical climate, this will be a meaningful accomplishment. To get here, we made significant progress on several key initiatives to drive higher margins. We achieved a substantial turnaround in pricing in the Americas. We have made progress in our manpower planning and shuttling initiatives, where we continue to see results in our productivity metrics. We have aggressively mitigated the effects of weaker vehicle residual values through the work of our fleet optimization and fleet management teams. And we have rigorously controlled costs, while still investing in the key areas that we targeted earlier this year."

The inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and reduced global growth forecasts caused concern about economic weakness and contributed to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.

It remains the case, 3.5 years on, that not a single significant strategic or operational decision that we have made or not made has been driven externally by political influences. We've been managing the company for all its shareholders in the best way we know how. And therefore, all I know is what's happened so far, and I have no reason to believe that will change. But of course, there are risks in the future, but that's the position so far. The second thing that I'd say is we all have to recognize that the banking industry is quite politicized everywhere in the world today, as a result of its role in the financial crisis and the tensions, the political tensions arising from the financial crisis. And so banks equals politics, whether that's in Spain or Germany or here or America or Ireland, or you pick it. And in that sense, there are political risks and calculations that have to be made for the banking industry and the regulations it affected and the other pressures that can be on it. We've seen that in the U.K., away from RBS, rather recently. So I do think that bank investors are right to worry about politics, but it's not clear to me that RBS is particularly distinguished in that regard. But clearly, the best way we can insulate ourselves from this is to do our jobs well. I think if we fall down on the job, we invite more interference from whatever quarters. If we do our jobs well, we'll be left to get on with doing it."

Right now, we kind of think about population sequencing programs as ones that are sponsored by the government and are really directed to understanding the diversity of the population in some countries, understanding a reference genome that's likely underrepresented in the reference work that's been done previously, and then understanding the variation in their local population and then trying to learn enough about those variations medically to be able to influence what's happening clinically in that country. So that's kind of how we think about POP seq. In the U.S., there's lots of sales we've made of X Tens that are not that, but in other countries, there's some that are certainly borrowing sample streams from the clinical work that's going on in the country, Garvan being an example. So if you think about that, could Garvan become a POP seq project in the next 5 years? Maybe they will. Sidra is another example, where we're installing an X Ten and there's a possibility that, that morphs into a population sequencing project. So I think the lines are going to get a little bit blurry, but probably in the next year or 2, we kind of think that these POP seq projects as digitally incremental to what we're doing in the base X Ten business."

I think the legacy on-premise e-mail security equipment, the level of innovation and investment that's gone into many of those platforms by the vendors that sold them has really not extended to deal with the more modern targeted attacks. So URL-based threats, weaponized attachments that contain the latest ransomware and polymorphic attacks and impersonation attacks. So really, the effectiveness of these solutions is failing customers and that's seeking them -- that is driving them to seek change. I think the second and another very important aspect here is that as customers look more and more to use cloud-based e-mail services like Office 365, the idea of backhauling their traffic onto their networks through these on-premises appliance-type strategies is far less attractive. And so they look for more of a cloud-to-cloud-based model for deploying e-mail security alongside their cloud e-mail investments."

In terms of oil demand, the 2012 outlook has also stabilized after a series of downward revisions in recent quarters. Based on the weakness of non-OPEC supply, OPEC spare capacity being at the 3-year low and supply risks from a number of sources, we do not expect oil prices to weaken significantly in the coming quarters. In the U.S., the production growth from unconventional gas, coupled with very mild winter weather, has driven storage to record levels. This has sent natural gas prices to a 10-year low and has led to a subsequent drop in gas activity, which is unlikely to recover in the near term."

So this is a long-term sustainable downdraft. I mean clearly, over the last year or so, there's a lot of volatility created here.

The impact of higher long-term interest rates continued to affect both new loan commitments, which were down 27% to $212 million, as well as spreads, down 5 basis points to $148 million. The mortgage servicing income decline was due to the absence of a third quarter $1.7 million reversal of the last of our mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance.

So I do think that there'll be a little bit of a shakeout. Having said that, as a general trend, solar will be -- has been in developed world the largest new energy generation resource and is -- almost everyone is projecting that it will continue to be in most markets. So that will mean, in our view, intense competition for the foreseeable future in mainstream power plant. There's still ability to differentiate in power plants. Location matters, local knowledge matters in terms of the cost to perfecting the site. You can get a premium depending on your transmission position. So selectively, you can get better PPAs in, we believe, the Americas. But if you say broadly worldwide, I think our view is changing to intensely competitive certainly for the foreseeable future. And our plan is the Oasis and P-Series in other parts of the world that will compete in that intensely competitive market, however, selectively or as a solutions provider. So kind of a mixed answer.

The effects of foreign exchange and lower-priced corn, which is passed through in our selling prices, were partially offset by the solid volume growth. Gross profit was down $19 million as a result of unfavorable currency, primarily in South America and modest margin compression in North America from higher net corn costs. Adjusted operating income was lower than last year by $8 million as the decline in gross profit was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses. Reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by $35 million. This reflects $33 million from a noncash charge of goodwill impairment in Southern Cone, given the political and economic volatility and continued uncertainty. In addition, we incurred $2 million from the acquisition costs related to the Penford transaction. Our earnings per share reported and adjusted EPS were $0.83 and $1.30 per share, respectively.

So we've done a combination of modeling Europe as a totality or taking countries inside Europe that, as best as possible, would potentially emulate practices of all behaviors in the U.S. And we use those models to create long-range plans. Obviously, these are our best assumptions at present, and only time will tell in terms of the way the market will actually go."

I know that there's a lot of discussion back in Washington, D.C. about both an extenders package in general and specifically, about the biodiesel tax credit. It's going to be an issue that's certainly going to be brought up. I hesitate to really give you a guess on whether or not it's going to be prospective or retroactive. While I've always continued to believe and what I've always said I think to everyone is that the farm community strongly supports the biodiesel tax credit. And so whether it comes in prospectively or retroactively, we believe that there's strong political momentum to eventually have it in place. But there's a lot of discussion, and there's a lot of discussion on changing it from a producers -- from a blender's to a producer's tax credit as well. Generally in Washington, D.C., once you have something, particularly a tax program, in effect in a particular manner, it's hard to change it. And so while I know that -- I strongly believe -- nobody knows what Washington, D.C. will do. But I strongly believe that we will have a tax credit either prospectively or retroactively for next year. The chances of it actually being converted to a producer's cash credit are probably less solid than the fact that it does actually get implemented as a blender's just because you're changing the format. And there's always resistance to change anytime you try to do something like that."

So in the future, you would hope and expect that those could improve. But there are other cases that are unrelated that we may see different trends coming the other way.

We have slightly narrowed our organic growth outlook by 50 basis point, and this reflects the solid organic growth achieved in the first half of 2016, contract launches and progress within our IFS business in general. However, we remain cautious on certain European countries and also Brazil.

EBITA grew in this sector 4.5% to EUR 207 million, with a return on sales of 9.5%. Here we saw an improved contribution from the Aircraft Division, helped by the growing activity associated with the EFA Kuwait program; and also better results from Aerostructures, helping offset an expected lower contribution from ATR where deliveries were lower.

One of the things -- people need to make the hard decision taking older rigs out of the market that aren't going to work and even for those who have newer fleets, making the decision that if there's not work in the foreseeable future that you take the rig out of the market for a period of time and cold stack it. So what you bid has a little bit to do with what you see for the future of the rig, where you are in the geography, what the client is and what the future prospect in the area is. And I think you're talking about different levels when you talk short-term work and long-term work. Obviously, we look at it on a portfolio basis.

There's an unrestricted block of cash, which only sits in what we call RigCo or -- which is a sort of main operating entity.

And it's also clear that cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a valid methodology to measure exercise capacity. In fact, the readthrough from measures like PVR are more directly correlated with some of the endpoints that you see in CPET compared to, for example, 6-minute walk. So we will be testing 6-minute walk in the study, but we fundamentally believe that cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a more informative and sensitive measure, meaning that's important in an incident patient population that will be also receiving essentially best standard of care dual-background therapy and then ralinepag or placebo on top of that.

There's no kind of political risk associated with that. It's -- the claim that has been reported to us I described as very murky, and the more questions we ask, the murkier it seems to get. So I don't know. It could well be that, over time, we'll -- as we complete the adjusting process, we'll conclude, \"Gee that's a covered claim.\" But there's so many open questions and so much murkiness around it that at this point, it's hard for us to reach any conclusion. It may -- depending on the outcome of that adjusting process, you could envision a scenario where this drags on for an extended period of time and perhaps, ultimately, in litigation and things like that, and that just drags things out. So yes, we'll stay on top of it, but because the potential for dispute is there, we'd probably have limited ability to provide too much commentary.

The in-house costs, they have been split between various other lines such as, again, [indiscernible] and then consumables [indiscernible] and so on and so forth. What you see is transportation expenses with that third-party provider. So basically what happened in the program that we've been undertaking was aimed at the growth of the utilization rates of our own truck fleet. And we managed to get better technical state of our fleet and to improve on the punctuality on the delivery windows and on how we do the routing for our trucks. And thanks to all these measures, we've managed to get away from a lot of third-party contractors and that brought savings as well. And the second part of the reduction of this cost is related predominately to the share and the value of the impacts of the groups. And during this year, for various reasons, we'll prefer to buy a lot of products in the domestic market rather than from other countries, so that also had certain impact on this transportation expense. Overall, from the management account, because how we internally view our transportation expense kind of on all-inclusive basis, I can confirm that they lower substantially cost reductions in cost of delivery as well. So it relates not only to third parties, but also to in-house logistics."

But we really think the opportunity to grow the utilization of vector-borne disease screening is a bigger opportunity than to realize price. So interestingly, there are 70 million-plus dogs in the U.S. and not all of them go to the veterinary clinic, unfortunately. 35 million are on some kind of heartworm preventative. And only 21 million of them, roughly -- these are all rough numbers -- are tested annually for heartworm, even though it's really recommended to test before we put them on a preventative. And then less than 9 million of those have a heartworm test associated with the full vector-borne disease screen, even though 75%, 80% of the dogs in the country are exposed to ticks. So we think that there is an opportunity to continue to expand the utilization of heartworm and, in this case, vector-borne disease screening.

But if you look at it sequentially from our military business, we were down about 700 hours from the first quarter, so we're down about 9%. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis, second quarter last year to second quarter this year, we were actually in total, not just Omni, but also counting the cargo side, we were up about 4% on total military flying.

Second, we look at the belt, this is going to be one dimension of the development plan. In 1 year time, we'll tell you basically what could be or what should be the policy of the group looking at the payout ratio. Historically, we were in between 0.33% and 40%.

But in addition, we had impairment losses of $185 million and a net tax expense of $7 million. The impairment loss is mainly in our Tertre plant in Belgium, reflecting a more conservative outlook on long-term ammonia prices due to the expected effects of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and that this particular plant currently has limited flexibility to import ammonia. Despite having a loss before tax, we recognized a net tax expense of $7 million, and this is mainly due to the Tertre impairment being realized without a tax effect. And in addition, we had losses in certain countries that are not recognized as deferred tax assets.

Country risk as well as currency fluctuation as well as cost as well as how long it's going to take us to develop, all that goes into play. And what we have to do is make some decisions and balance that risk against the opportunity and take a step that we believe is in the best interest of creating value for the company and for the shareholders. So it's no easy answer. We're a long way from putting steel in the ground or even making a decision about putting steel in the ground in anywhere.

We've made excellent progress in our efforts to increase JPF production to meet customer demand, supported by a strong pipeline of orders already in our program backlog of more than $230 million. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for additional orders, including the next Air Force contract and a recent approval by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency of a possible FMS sale to the UAE for almost 15,000 JPFs, which would bring production visibility into 2020.

For the fourth quarter, our results reflect another period with a slight reduction in revenue that was due in large part to the sluggish domestic economy. Despite these economic conditions, we maintained our relentless focus on revenue quality and cost controls and are pleased with our consistent financial performance. While our diluted earnings per share decreased as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, the decrease in our pretax income was primarily due to a $30.7 million increase in fringe benefit cost that was partially driven by changes to our phantom stock plans. Adam will address the phantom stock plan expense in more detail, but the amendments to these plans in December '19 should prevent fluctuations in our share price from materially impacting our earnings in future periods. The overall operating environment in the fourth quarter felt similar to what we experienced for most of 2019. We won't, again, continue with the decrease in LTL terms, although we were pleased to see our volumes perform in line with normal seasonality when compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was the first time this year that we were in line with our normal seasonal trend. We are encouraged by this volume trend as well as economic forecast for the industrial economy to improve in -- during 2020.

Our brokerage account growth outpaced our growth over the past 3 years, with more than 120,000 net new accounts. And we kept more of those accounts on board with account retention at an all-time high. A similar story in brokerage assets. Net new assets into the firm were at their highest annual level since we began tracking the metric in 2007. Not bad, and all during a year when the retail investor largely remained on the sidelines, as evidenced by lower trading activity than we have seen in 6 years.

The Discovery House transaction is the CTC facilities that we acquired, and every day just about you're seeing or you're reading about a story or on 60 Minutes or on the news media talking about the opiate/heroin addiction issue in the country. So we think that is positioned well. In the U.K., the NHS continues to close beds and expects the private side of the business to build that capacity. So I think that trend will continue, and that's the most important trend for us. And then also I think the NHS -- we're beginning our rate negotiations. I think the NHS realized how important we are to the system. And so we're cautiously optimistic about the rate increases and the rate structure going forward.

Certainly, as Dave Engert spoke to in his prepared remarks, there's going to be absolutely a focus on utilization management, absolutely a focus on cost and access. And so we're expecting those things. But also, as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, the underlying demographic trends driving overall volumes in radiology are very positive and we continue to believe that those are going to happen, if anything, be mitigated somewhat by what's going on in Washington. So we'll see what happens. I guess I'll leave you with just one thought and it's something that we talked with our customers about and frankly we've talked with some people in your line of work about. Fundamentally, healthcare reform is going to be a catalyst for change in the radiology industry. It's going to be a catalyst for looking for more effective and efficient ways of delivering care across the country. And we like to think that teleradiology is perfectly positioned to exploit that opportunity and to help our physician radiology groups and their patients in that regard.

And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign and currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on devaluations. Because usually, after a devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that."

The SolarStorm attack highlighted that enterprises need a comprehensive, up-to-date map of their full IT infrastructure environment, including understanding their own networks as well as external attack surfaces and supply chains.  In order for security teams to have an edge over the adversaries, they need to embrace next-generation technologies that leverage AI, machine learning and automation. To help our customers, we set up a rapid response program. And when I say rapid, it was rapid. Our acquisitions of Expanse and Crypsis almost felt prescient. The team swung into action. We updated XDR for all the new threat vectors. We offered free assessments from our Crypsis team. We also evaluated the attack surfaces from the outside in for Expanse and discovered that there were dozens of affected customers, including major government agencies and large companies, many of which were actively communicating with SolarStorm malware command and control infrastructure. So far, we've received over 1,000 assessment requests and have completed over 500. We believe that the SolarStorm attack raises the mid- and long-term criticality of the cybersecurity industry as a whole. This will result in more awareness and focus on cybersecurity, which in all candor, is the need of the hour given the complete reliance on technology in these times. We expect that this attack will be a wake-up call to all enterprises to modernize cybersecurity and will serve as a net incremental tailwind, not just for us but also for the industry."

It's been a while now that companies we've had payment delays, a couple of days, throughout most of the portfolio. Then to check our records we have very little or nothing in terms of past-due loans for a long time. By the way, like Jaime just said, even the loans that we're currently restructuring, are actually current as to our interest and principal because the maturities haven't taken place. It's just that we have concluded that when principal maturities do occur, we're probably going to have to give those people more time to pay us back. Again, the magnitude of the problem is that we see coming down the pipeline is anywhere from $25 million to $35 million on which the $12 million in additional specific reserves that we established should be more than enough. That's a fairly conservative provision level on problems, on loans that become past-due. It's consistent with our experience.

Last year's tax provision was also affected by the company's payment in settlement of the lawsuit during the quarter ended September of 2009, which resulted in a tax benefit of $800,000, offset in part by losses in Asia principally related to the impairment of goodwill that had minimal tax benefit. On September 23, 2010, Bel received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service advising that federal tax returns for 2006 and 2008 had been selected for examination. Bel has commenced assembling documents request by the IRS for these examinations."

And there's a fair amount of volatility, as you know, in our Issuer Services specifically around Depositary Receipts. So ultimately, it is a reflection of the total amount of issuance and shares outstanding. But there are corporate actions and other things that tend to be a bit seasonal that can move that. So a little bit of the bump that you saw in the second quarter is reflective of that. It's somewhat offset by the very slow limited amount of activity that we're seeing in corporate trust, which again, is reflective of the amount of trusteeships that we have.

And it's often once you get a recovery but you see the lapses. So part of it is just customer behavior, a classical thing. As always, they were the last. They hold on to their shares and often, in those products, when you've recovered in equity market levels and people are back where they were, retail market tends to sell and get out. So I think that's been a large part of what you've seen there over and an underlying issue, so it's manageable. It would concern us if it was really localized at one country, like you saw Korea last year. This year, you saw a mixture of Indonesia and Malaysia and a bit of Korea, et cetera.

But for clients that want to have domestic-based programs given in a tough labor market, we think it's going to be -- really need is lot more. The second setback that we had was, really in a last few years, all of the heightened concern around cyber security, certain segments of our clients did get concerned about having home agents.

During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $1.79 and net income of $263 million, both of which were driven by a strong underlying performance of the business. I'd like to remind everyone what the underlying business is. AerCap is the world's largest owner of commercial aircraft. This provides us with tremendous scale and insight to the entire aviation industry. We place our aircraft in long-term leases to 200 customers in 80 countries. This diversification, coupled with our proactive approach to risk management, has contained credit cost to 1% of revenue throughout the last decade. The relentless focus of the AerCap platform on a consistent strategy and operating excellence has resulted in double-digit earnings growth and 12 years of uninterrupted GAAP profitability. This has been achieved despite a $147 oil, the financial crisis, the Eurozone crisis, et cetera. Furthermore, this unrivaled value-creation has been achieved without any large financial or industrial parent. This is the AerCap business."

As well, relating to the LIT acquisition, we believe that we have a leadership position in embedded security for high-performance processing for defense and intelligence applications. And with the wave of flow downs from DoD relating to program protection security requirements, we're exceptionally well positioned there and that becomes the driver of growth in not only domestic sales, but also for foreign military sales, where our customers are looking to export their capabilities overseas. That technology needs to be protected. And so we're kind of right in the middle of the -- of that particular trend. So overall, we feel that we're well positioned.

And as we indicated during the first quarter, where we also had a challenging overall market and geopolitical environment, that's often driven to effects outside of market factors. And it often is driven by large idiosyncratic inflows. It could be driven by an entrepreneur, either having gone through an IPO or actually wanting to look to monetize large positions that they have. So it's -- you don't always have direct correlation. So I wouldn't read much into the fact that we're lower this quarter than we were first quarter.

And here, we also had kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business that tends to be kind of lumpy because you're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers, and they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong, and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform. The integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

Do you, at some point of time, I mean, keeping the other macro headwinds and other things aside, do you, at some point of time, feel that size is probably becoming an impediment for us in terms of growing in, let's say, double digit.

So there's an opportunity there. We believe to create some disruptive offerings. The second is in terms of the security associated with these devices when they use network services, because it now is going on the public Internet. So we see CIOs constantly engaging us on security services for mobile applications used in enterprises. So these 2 are 2 big opportunities that we see that are adjacent to what we do that we can potentially enter in the mobility space. It's not consumer mobility or for us to become a mobile operator ourselves. It's taking mobile -- mobility service -- mobility or mobility enablement services to large enterprises."

Unfortunately, this also happens to be the area that has been drastically affected due to the pandemic. However, we expect 5G will initiate an explosion in the number of connected devices and along with it the need for IoT security. The current crisis has only exasperated the need for more automation. We are currently deploying our security solution in a 5G Edge cloud setup in APAC and are confident that it will become one of the reference sites for 5G security. Another interesting one is the deployment at a European fuel cell manufacturer, wherein we will be securing all the fuel cells that goes into electric cars made by these manufacturers. Further, we intend to strengthen our go-to-market channel for more big -- more strategic partners and OEMs."

Many countries outside the U.S. are experiencing slow growth impacted by weak currencies, high unemployment rates and geopolitical tensions. These factors continue to weigh on consumer spending and, in turn, the end markets in which we participate. For the past couple of quarters, we pointed towards sluggish TV demand as a key factor behind weak LED industry conditions. Potential TV growth drivers, including the Chinese New Year and Summer Olympics, have failed to spur TV demand. Research firm IHS now forecast a decline in Q1 2016 TV shipments, marking the first time since 2008 that first quarter shipments have declined year-over-year. Despite ongoing demand for general lighting, it will take the industry a bit longer to consume the excess LED supply created by weak display demand. For LED chip manufacturers, overcapacity conditions combined with intense price pressures continue to weigh on their profitability. Customers have started consolidating facilities and/or transitioning manufacturing to more profitable markets in order to improve their bottom line performance. We believe these actions bode well for MOCVD demand over the long term, however, we expect investments will likely remain soft throughout 2016."

And we see that back to kind of this historic norm of middle single digit consumer takeaway and do think that that's resilient. And unless there's some return to the 2008, 2009 economic challenges, that, that should be just good, steady growth accentuated by some new products and/or small acquisitions. On the Industrial side, about 70% of our revenues are maintenance, repair and remodeling. So both of those facts really answer part of your question in relationship to our company's resilience. As Rusty highlighted, the vast majority of our business in Europe, which is a little more than 20% of our total revenues, is in Northern Europe, and the largest portion of it is in Germany. I think our second largest geographic exposure or country exposure would be the U.K. We are concerned about what we're seeing there in terms of slowdown in a number of our European businesses. And obviously, to the extent that the euro continues to deteriorate, that will negatively impact all of our results as they're translated back in U.S. dollars whether or not the underlying core business has some positive sales and earnings growth or in some cases, which we're already seeing, some deterioration in their performance. So those are the key factors as it relates to how we think about the coming year.

So core civil infrastructure, transportation and water, which are the markets that we are most bullish about. It's entirely focused in the Western U.S., the Western states, including Hawaii, and it adds that capability in probably the hottest civil infrastructure market in the country right now. And so when you couple our market dominant position on the engineering design side with Shimmick that has an incredible position, where we now have both the design and the construction capabilities that is consistent with where the market is going. If you look back since 2010, over the last 7 years, we've seen a 50% increase in the number of integrated delivery or design build procurements for transportation projects here in the United States. And so that increasing integrated delivery requires us to have both the design and the construction capability. We're seeing that accelerating dramatically. The P3 market is accelerating dramatically. We're seeing it at LaGuardia, JFK, Penn Station. We're seeing 2 projects for $3 billion being led out by LAX here under the P3 model.

So I would say in the end, I think we guided that we mentioned something in the range of 200,000 subs for this year. We will be a little short of that, but that entire shortage will be in Argentina."

And really, we're performing really, really well, and this is basically from what I mentioned before, the high level of new wins that they have there in this area. In some countries, for example, you can think that Argentina we will never grow and there's a bit of pressure on this country, well, our growth is more on the 20%. And this is really coming from the new wins. So we -- usually, you can say that the economies and the growth of our business should be somewhere correlated. But we stated that the correlation will be a big difference between whether the country will grow and when you're winning by yourself. Organically, actually, we're not growing, but our new wins there should accelerate the growth in that region. And your question is almost in all countries, in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina."

This year, your competitors have started to move the customers aggressively on the bundle tariffs, which impacts your price per megabit [indiscernible], and you have to reduce the prices. And how this all would protect the market? And second question is on Ukraine. So results are quite good in the first quarter, a little bit surprising for me. How would you comment on your market share in Ukraine? So do you see that you are getting the market share from your main competitor?

Our experience matched up with the external markers from a geography standpoint with more severe incidents in Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri.

It's undoubtable that Internet is where the company has to go on a market share broadband basis, the consumer demand to utilize higher speeds with new technologies coming in with 12, 14 devices attached to the home through Wi-Fi. As we look out, it may just so clear and most importantly, the compelling metrics from Québec City, from the Aliant footprint where the churn is lower, the ARPU's better, it's clearly where to go. And now there have been modem restrictions on speed capabilities, et cetera. In fact, even when we launched the 1 gigabit service on Monday, it will say 940, because we have to wait for the next modem that takes it over 100, so over the 1. So it's the exact same technology that Google's launched in the United States. And so we definitely, just excited about what it's going to do for us in the future from a competitive perspective, and that's why we're making the investment. There's no doubt, the one thing I would say, depending on the geography in the country and subscriptions to OTT services, some markets are much heavier users of OTT services than other. And so they may have higher demands for speed than some of the other geographies. And so we'll have to see that as we go out. But clearly, the reason we're -- everywhere we have fiber, we're just going to launch this product."

So what Qualys offers is the ability to identify and catalog all of the web applications, and we do that extremely well.

And that's the driver of adoption for our marketplace. So we replace a lot of these traditional tools, which requires an engineer to go -- a security expert to use the tool, to identify probabilities as we bring significantly more valuation.

Our recommended remediation steps for these customers, therefore, also included total replacements. Our analysis also led us to believe that financial gain was not the likely motive and that the information was not as useful in targeting individual consumer accounts. However, on a case-by-case basis, we offered additional remediation such as risk-based authentication to customers protecting web-based consumer financial transactions. The suspicions that our attack was targeting the defense sector was reinforced in June when Lockheed Martin disclosed an unsuccessful attack on its systems had utilized, among other elements, information taken in the attack on RSA. Lockheed Martin had implemented many security measures, including our best practices and successfully detected and thwarted this attack. Subsequently, they accelerated their plans for total replacements to complete their SecurID remediation. I would note the Lockheed Martin incident was not the result of a new attack on RSA, and there was no change in customer risk or recommended remediation steps. What did change was our customer's sensitivity to risk. This was caused by the same news flow around cyber attacks as in addition to press coverage of the attack on Lockheed Martin, there was broad media coverage of attacks on organizations including Google, Sony, Epsilon, the Australian government and PBS. While these attacks were entirely unrelated to RSA, the publicity resulted in many customers risk tolerance going down while the level of awareness and concern went up."

Is this business -- is it more costly to put this new business on than it was in the past? Or is there certain issues with respect to some products in various countries? I did notice that the Asia expenses are up significantly year-over-year as well, like they're up something in the area of like 20%. So is there anything else that's driving the fact that you're still getting the same kind of negative impact from strain despite the higher sales?"

I can't now say nothing on very good news that is coming to Argentina and that would be public in the next days. And so only also to say that some positive outcome comes also from Argentina in this period. Remember that because of the volatility of the particular period of the country, we are working as said in cash flow manner in the sense that so we are financing investments in Argentina with the cash that Argentina is producing. And this is the way we think is the best way to keep on our options that so could have a big value if Argentina will stabilize. And it's clear that for the entire group today, Argentina is putting a big impact in terms of EPA inflation accounting and FX. But remember that the business within the country is fully hedged against CPI because the distribution business is fully hedged on CPI hedge in the sense that CPI is increasing tariff for 100% of the impact.

But when you think about biosimilars, we expect the impact in the first few years in any of these countries to be relatively slow for the following reasons: these will be the first monoclonal antibody biosimilars approved in EU. In general, we don't believe that they're going to take patients off of their current therapy. We think that the product will be limited to new patients, they won't switch if patients are controlled. And then you're going to need to have mechanisms for approval for reimbursement, for physician familiarity, because it's not going to be necessarily therapeutically substitutable. So it's going to take a lot of support and promotion to be successful in the marketplace. So we continue to watch it and monitor it well. But at this point, we feel confident that we'll continue to be successful with REMICADE and SIMPONI."

The Security Paper Product segment continues to be adversely impacted by a strong Swiss franc relative to the euro and overcapacity in the industry resulting in sales competition for tenders. Despite these difficulties, Landqart has a strong order book with good visibility well into the second half of the year. The mill is currently operating at full capacity. Estimated volumes to be produced and sold in 2015 are expected to be significantly higher than in 2012. Landqart is now producing its second order of its new composite paper-polymer-paper substrate Durasafe and is pursuing several more sales opportunities for this new product. The second orders of Durasafe includes security threats from Fortress optical film division. Landqart has also been awarded paper orders in several new markets during the first quarter of 2013. These orders are expected to be produced and delivered later this year. The Landqart mill has substantially completed the majority of the production of its largest banknote order and has delivered over 70% of its contract volume. The Landqart mill is continuing its efforts to enter into new markets to diversify its customer base in preparation for the competition of this contract. The company is confident that it will continue to meet its sales targets through a combination of repeat orders in established markets together with new business. Landqart has improved operational results systematically over the past 2 quarters and management anticipates this trend to continue through the second quarter of 2013."

As you may already know, in January, new authorities took office in every region of the country since reelection, which used to be possible at the regional and local level, is no longer so. This naturally generates some delays in public spending as authorities go through a learning curve both in terms of actual state of affairs left by the previous authority and in terms of learning the processes and procedures needed to materialize public investment."

There is now, in São Paulo and some of the large cities, a very tough law with respect to drinking and driving that has made an important dent on the consumption of beverages, especially for beers. And obviously, for us, on-premise volumes have also decreased because fewer people are attending bars and that kind of beverage consumption at night because -- it is called the zero tolerance alcohol consumption, and it's really -- what I understand is that even with drinking 1 beer, if you're driving, you're in trouble, as opposed to other countries where there's a probably a more flexible, if I may use that word, level of alcohol in the blood levels. That has put a lot of pressure on the beer companies. Our beer volumes are -- Heineken volumes that we saw were also affected by that. And that has created a little bit more pressure on the CSD front, because the competitors are also looking to recuperate part operate of that, I guess, volume being lost in beer. So we are seeing a little more competitive pressure there, but I don't think that it's something to worry about at this point."

Our gross profit margin of 81.2% was 50 basis points above the prior year, primarily reflecting favorable manufacturing variances and foreign exchange. Operating expenses rose 140 basis points to 60.4% of sales. The largest driver of the increase was higher general and administrative cost of 150 basis points, primarily reflecting strategic investment and capabilities, such as R&D and information technology as well as our acquisition activities. Retail store expenses rose 40 basis points, reflecting the addition of almost 150 freestanding retail stores over the past year. Partially offsetting these increases was 60 basis points of favorability and advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses, due primarily to the mix impact from the strong growth of our lower advertisement brands as well as the cadence of major launch activities for our heritage brands."

We remain very confident about the continued long-term growth outlook for the business and overall markets. We still anticipate currency headwinds of approximately 3%, resulting in constant currency growth of 29%. You may wonder why this has not increased due to the recent fall of the British pound. But while the pound has fallen compared to our expectations early in the year, we have seen improvements in the Russian ruble and Canadian dollar that have offset, keeping full year currency headwind of approximately in the same range. The full year GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.05 with an effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.97, which includes a tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments.

Our strategy is to grow into that space, and Dan is working on helping us with specific opportunity, near term, intermediate term, to penetrate more into that space. We already have a quite nice presence there, and feel like we have a good chance of increasing there. The other big thing that can happen nationally, is a national strategy for Cyber which hasn't really emerged. There's been a lot of discussion and even at the Congressional level, a lot of proposed legislation. There's some prospect that the Department of Homeland Security may have a bigger role, let's say, outside of the classified environment for architecture standards sort of buttoning up or protecting, defending more the total national critical infrastructure for Cyber. And that could spawn new requirements that would be more pure Cyber content. But right now, it is the fact that most agencies are sort of on their own defining what their needs are in Cyber, closing gaps and using existing contract vehicles that they already have for IT services to achieve that increased hardening activity."

So on a year-on-year basis, I think that you are anticipating some profit growth, so can you share with us the basis, on which basis are you seeing that you would be able to grow your profit? And quarter-by-quarter, by which quarter do you think that you will be able to turn around your profit trend? My second question has to do with the regulation. I think that there have been pressures coming from KCC and there are 2 major elections planned for the rest of the year, which means there will be a higher pressure coming from the political sector, regarding the tariff cuts going forward. And if you look at the basic fees for LTE smartphones, it does seem rather high and currently, you are providing discounts on top of such basic fees. So from the perspectives of the subscribers and the government and the regulators, these basic fees might appear a little too high, calling for further pressure to cut down on the tariff. So I was wondering, rather than going it this way, do have plans to actually provide the discounted tariff number as the official basic fee?"

We anticipate significant growth driven by the increased capacity from a full year of operating the National Geographic Quest and the impact of the voyage cancellations in 2017. The Lindblad segment is currently pacing $28 million ahead of the same point a year ago, and we are already at 90% of our full year projected ticket revenues for 2018, despite the additional inventory that we had in the upcoming year, as compared with 85% of the 2017 full year ticket revenue at the same time a year ago. It is important to note that while venture will launch late in 2018 and contribute to the revenue growth in the current year, it will have a negative impact on EBITDA, as it will have startup cost ahead of its December launch."

And that the story was more about the lack of having defined benefit plans as much as it was around 401(k). So you had two of the three individuals that were not even yet eligible for retirement, who took early retirement without having significant savings. One of the challenges the industry faces is to making sure to qualify those stories and we did respond it, both as an industry and as a company to say that the story was frankly a very inadequate and trying to articulate the challenges of 401(k), and the fact that if we're going to compete globally, the probability is this country is just not going to have a lot of defined benefit plans going forward."

But pulling out of the Eastern European -- some of the Eastern European markets given the economic turmoil, and pulling out of a number of the Middle East markets because of political unrest and then taking those actions from 2011 and annualizing them over 2012, represents a fair amount of what that capacity reduction is."

So the KYC-related activities had a cost increase, quarterly cost increase by EUR 75 million. There's another effect here that you see. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018, you may remember that we had a reduced accrual for performance-related pay last year on the back of the settlement. And that's an important factor, as a consequence of which, now you see an increased cost if it comes to performance-related pay for this year. Now quarter-on-quarter, expenses, excluding regulatory costs, were EUR 38 million higher. This was mainly driven by the KYC-related costs, some investments in business growth. The CLA impact that we have seen in many different countries in which the salaries are basically increasing have been generally absorbed by cost discipline. So we were able to neutralize most of that so that the real cost drivers are KYC, regulatory costs as well as some business growth where we can afford it."

And having an established position in the country, we will look for opportunities to invest for value and to potentially harvest capital as the recovery unfolds."

If you miss a painting window in February because the store is closed or traffic's just impaired and contractors can't get to the job site. It doesn't tend to get delayed for quarters or years.

These are a manageable excise tax environment, stable industry volume trends, our superior brand portfolio, our market share growth, a favorable pricing environment, limited input cost increases and strong productivity gains. The threat of disruptive excise taxes has always been a concern. However, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases usually do not generate the targeted increase in government revenues nor are they sustainable. Consequently, there have been no excise tax increases implemented or announced so far this year that we would deem to be extreme in any of our key markets, despite large government budget deficits in numerous countries. On the contrary, we are witnessing a more reasonable approach both in terms of incidents and the structure of excise taxes, most notably in the European Union, as governments are keen to secure sustainable revenue streams from tobacco taxation. Several countries in Europe are most likely to increase general VAT rates this year. But overall, we believe that such increases should be manageable."

The end markets are still very challenged and are challenged consistently across all geographies in which we operate. Clearly, our view remains unchanged, that construction has not yet bottomed. But we are encouraged with our results. And we've said many times before, I think what we're seeing is kind of the strength of the diversity of our portfolio at this point. We've got broad-based, positive sales growth in Construction, it's not unique in one geography. Backlog grew in the quarter, and it's across many other, I'll call it, range of profitable niches that we play in across our business. One other point of color that may help, we saw a good, balanced contribution from both the U.S. and Canada. Canada grew a little better than the 15%. It grew at 17% for Construction. The U.S. grew at 14%. So on a combined basis, it was 15%. And I'll tell you, it's interesting as well, the sales to contractors in the Construction segment was up for both datacomm and electrical contractors this quarter. So we're encouraged that it wasn't just the strength of datacomm that carried the day."

Overall, orders were flat year-over-year in North America Installation & Services as service growth of 3% was offset by a 3% decline in installation orders. As we have said previously, order rates can be lumpy, particularly in the installation business, and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. From a dollar perspective, installation orders were higher on a quarter sequential basis. That is why we often refer to backlog as the key indicator. In the second quarter, backlog in North America Installation & Services of $2.4 billion increased 2% on a quarter sequential basis.

While the caution still factors in to our decision making today, some important developments have taken place. The fourth quarter and much of 2012 have been characterized by the restructuring and refinancing of our business. Through this process and the performance of our businesses, we have also created a framework for disciplined growth. We successfully completed our debt financing strategy in a way that generated maximum value for our shareholders. The corporation had its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in revenue and complemented that performance with strong operating cash flow. Progress continued on increasing operating margins at each of the groups and finally, we have maintained healthy backlogs across the country --  the company. So while market demand conditions will go through their cycles, our teams stay focused on serving their customers, on operational excellence through 80/20, generating and preserving cash and ultimately creating value for shareholders. We are proud of our performance in 2012, and I'd like to use this opportunity to thank our shareholders, our customers, certainly, our valued employees and our many important partners that have helped us.

You might remember that we acquired 3 small buildings on Newbury Street in Boston within the last 18 months in hopes of growing our presence there dramatically by getting the opportunity to own a large portfolio there controlled by Anglo Irish Bank. We had hoped to deal with Anglo Irish directly and avoid having the portfolio go through a broad public marketing process, it didn't work out that way. The portfolio was market publicly and not surprisingly, found lots of interest. Portfolio sold to a foreign back fund at a price we're unwilling to pay. Accordingly, we have little interest in maintaining our 3 small buildings on Newbury Street and sold them to the same buyer as a larger portfolio. Sales price was nearly double our cost 18 months ago and you'll see the $12 million gain on sale in a future quarter. Cap rate paid was well below 4% on 2011 trailing NOI and barely 4% at 2012 forecasted NOI.

They just changed their President. So it's a little bit more difficult to advance projects, so hence, our ability to finalize some discussion with potential partners that we have. So Peru is a place where we would like to be active as well. Panama could be also another place that we feel secure enough. Columbia is a little bit more complicated and I'm not so sure that we're so interested. Brazil is huge, but we don't seem to have a handle there. It's just baked in many, many players, so we don't see where we can add value. Argentina, eventually, is a place where there's a lot of possibility. But for now, their financial position as a country is very challenging. So that's why we have looked into Chile and Peru as our first preferred market. Panama, like I said, could be something, but Panama is a very small market. You remember that we've looked in Mexico.

And of course we are not as large there directly, and we did not have a joint business with JAL at that point in time. So there are some unique regional challenges that have impacted us given our geography. And even over the Pacific, one of the areas that, on a year-over-year basis, did not increase as much as some of the other ones if for example, Japan because it was stronger the year before. So there are some unique sub-geographies within a geography. And then in the case of Latin America, for example, there are regions -- like in Brazil, we've seen pretty good economic growth but there were some other regions, and specifically I can comment on Mexico. So going back a little bit in history, in 2009, there was a unique impact from the H1N1. And that made the Caribbean pretty strong that year. So if you look at the Caribbean in 2010, it did not show some of the same strength and that's a large region for us. So there are kind of unique geographical impact that I would say.

So what did we learn? First, our portfolio is resilient. Under the sustainable development scenario, a sub-2-degree world, all of our current projects remain strongly NPV positive. This reflects a climate resilient portfolio that can continue to meet global energy demand. Second, our oil assets, which are generally short dated, see very limited impact to their NPVs. Our Gulf of Mexico and Ghana assets see almost no value erosion. Both assets are relatively short-dated, the Gulf of Mexico having fast paybacks and Ghana having license expiry in the mid-2030s. Third, country risk and fiscal take under different climate scenarios may have some impact. Our actual Guinea asset could face greater potential value erosion than Ghana despite a similar production life, given the greater dependency of Equatorial Guinea on oil revenues. Fourth, our Mauritania and Senegal LNG assets provide cleaner sources of energy into the long term. The NPV of our Mauritania and Senegal asset is impacted to some degree under the sustainable development scenario as a result of the asset's longevity. However, the impact is not significant, largely because natural gas is recognized in these scenarios to be a key energy source for meeting global energy demand over the medium term. Fifth, long-dated oil exploration faces significant value erosion and experiences the greatest value impact under the scenarios."

Looking back in our business activity in August, really, we didn't see much of a change in August this year relative to last year. So, obviously, as I commented before, there is an environment now of economic uncertainty, but it's very early, and from what we see so far, it doesn't really impact the business. So we didn't change our guidance to reflect any downward in economic activity. As we commented and as we experienced from the last recession 2 years ago, in our enterprise Work Optimization tends to be -- have less impact than other IT companies from a potential recession because of the nature of the ROI and the nature of the solutions helping organizations to maintain cost and be effective in how they deploy their people.

This customer adopted Datadog to support their e-commerce site ahead of the new iPhone launch. Our platform enabled them to have a successful launch without any major performance issues, while other carriers in the country experienced website outages because of traffic surges. This initial 6-figure land includes all 3 pillars: infrastructure, APM and logs as well as Synthetics. Second, an established Fortune 500 retailer had a 6-figure upsell. This customer adopted infrastructure monitoring in 2017, followed by both APM and Log in 2018 and more recently, Synthetics. Over 100 of their internal teams are using Datadog as they adopt Microsoft Azure and container technologies. This customer's spend with us has grown more than 5x since our initial deal, and we believe there is still a lot more room for growth. Next, one of our largest Q3 deals was a 7-figure, 3 pillars, new logo from a higher education software and services company. This mid-market customer with fewer than 5,000 employees demonstrates the spending power of even midsized companies as they come to Datadog as a strategic partner to support their digital businesses. Finally, a large Europe-based shipping and logistics company with origins dating back over 100 years, had a 6-figure upsell in the quarter. This company was previously using built-in cloud provider monitoring tools, which lack the ability to correlate front- and back-end issue. And this is a powerful example of how Datadog enables companies in all regions and industries who are in the middle of their digital transformation."

From our perspective, because we're account writers, when we look at an overall commercial account, we will write the commercial auto. And at some -- sometimes, it's a little bit at a loss in terms of rate adequacy. And so we're working hard to make sure that, from a rate perspective, we're taking some rate increases in commercial auto. The other aspect of it too, which you're starting to see again across industry is, as the economy picks up, you're having frequency, you're having additional drivers on the road. In some areas of the business sector, you're having qualifications of those drivers. Is it -- are they running the appropriate background checks on those drivers? From our perspective, our underwriting is still, I think, extremely well done, and I think it's partially rate adequacy and frequency and it's -- those are the 2 things that we're addressing. And as I noted in my comments, we are piloting a predictive analytics tool for commercial auto, and we're about to implement that in a couple of states.

There's certain restructurings that will come in connection with this as we move from, let's say, every country running their own administration to centralizing that and possibly offshoring it, would result in some one-off charges.

A smaller or a nonregulated industry company, security and operational issues tend to be more at the forefront. And just to echo what Cam said, I think in the world of IT products of any sort, even security, if there is a value proposition to be discussed, relative to cost management or cost reduction, it's always a great way to get the dialogue going. And that's an even better dialogue if they're replacing, displacing older legacy technology that they know has become somewhat costly to maintain and inefficient to use. So I think we quite often get people's attention on compliance and/or security.

Our customers are looking for this level of security and risk management. As we've highlighted in the past, we've hired 2 very significant leaders over that area, Greg Montana and Greg Schaffer. They're both doing an outstanding job driving our security and risk management protocols. And it's resonating in our conversations. I will tell you, we don't have -- especially in the large financial institution market, we really don't have a conversation where at some point in time, we don't get into what are the best practices that we're pursuing around risk and security. And so I do think under the new normal, this will pay dividends for us in the future."

However, despite price increases in some of our major countries, the combination of price pressure in some peripheral markets and weaker sheet prices resulted in our average corrugated prices remaining flat in the quarter in local currency terms.

The benchmark Brent crude price rose 9% year-on-year to average at $50 per barrel, with several unplanned outages as well as geopolitical tensions. Naphtha prices rose in tandem with crude oil, pushing up petrochemical product prices amidst tighter supply and stronger demand. With this improved market scenario, PCG recorded a 24% year-on-year increase in revenue at MYR 4 billion compared to MYR 3.2 billion in the corresponding quarter. This is the result of higher sales volume and improved product prices supported by favorable foreign exchange impact. EBITDA for the quarter was MYR 1.5 billion, an increase of 26% from that recorded in the same quarter last year, driven by higher volume, improved spread and favorable foreign exchange movement. However, EBITDA margin maintained at a healthy level of 38%. Profit after tax surged by 92% to MYR 1 billion from MYR 533 million."

And I think importantly as well, when we look at sort of the growth opportunities, there's -- one of the things I'm keen to look at is capital allocation and competition for capital. An ability to diversify away from Sukari, clearly, have some advantages around both country and the operational risk diversification. But in terms of brownfield expansions, sort of competition for capital, we'll have to look carefully at where we get the best bang for our buck as well.

Naturally, we hope a peaceful resolution as soon as possible, so as to safeguard the safety of our customers and employees and resume network services for so many people affected by the fighting.

And so -- and those are 2 distinct -- they run 2 distinct R&D facilities. And so those 2 products, platforms were designed independently of each other. So even though they're both owned by Canon, that doesn't make them an end-to-end solution. It means they have now components that can be put together to make a system, but they weren't designed from the ground up as an end-to-end solution like Avigilon. And if you throw in the mix as well the parent company being Canon, our reports indicate that the Canon product and Canon sales organization is still actively selling against Axis and Milestone, and vice versa. So I'm not sure that that's really a unified end-to-end.

Virtually all the improvement was due to increased earnings with negligible effect from shares outstanding. The effect of currency translation on quarterly results was slightly positive, but not significant. As mentioned in the previous comments, the vast majority of the sales increase over Q1 2016 was due to volume improvements. The larger shares of sales increase came from Utility Support Structures, where sales growth also realized in the Irrigation and Energy and Mining. The increases in Engineered Support Structures and Coating sales were due to increased sales to other Valmont segments. This is a good example of how we leverage capabilities across geographies and segments to create a more effective global supply chain.

Despite very challenging operating conditions, the team was able to focus on the health and safety of their fellow employees and our residents by implementing our new operating standards to address COVID concerns. These heightened cleanliness standards have been well received by residents and prospects. The team elevated their voices in various listening sessions held throughout our organization to share how they were navigating and managing stress due to the unrest in our country. Their voices will help us continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion at Equity Residential."

This includes balancing business decisions between short-term impact and long-term perspective, intelligently and effectively. On the one hand, we have measures to combat the massive impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business and the way we work. And on the other hand, we have future projects we plan to continue or even accelerate. The BMW Group is in a strong position and well prepared to handle the challenges on both sides. We've intensified and accelerated our Performance > NEXT program through which we have tapped considerable potential on both the cost and the performance side since 2017. 6We continue to electrify our product portfolio and are bringing new models onto the markets at the right time. And we are using the time to make our supply chain even more sustainable. All of this helps us to balance business, environmental and societal challenges equally."

We're not expecting for any significant change in the European economy going forward. So it's getting the cost structure in line with the level of business that we're currently conducting there. We would expect to get benefit from that initially in the second half of this year, and I think Larry mentioned a number of around $5 million that we expect to generate this year, most of that being in the fourth quarter, and then the annualized effect of that going into 2013 will be significant. As I mentioned also, Europe is still an important part of our strategy. It's a big, meaningful market for both us and the world. There's still a lot of growth potential in Europe, not only in the more mature countries within Europe, but in the Middle East and Africa, which is all part of our European market.

And probably the biggest difference is cloud adoption. Certain countries are more ahead on cloud adoption, the U.S., the U.K., Australia, really Northern Europe. Interestingly, Japan is really coming on where cloud adoption is getting stronger. And that's partly driving our strong Japanese growth. And Germany is probably a half step behind on cloud adoption and dealing with more some of the German security and data localization issues. And so I think that offers real growth opportunity in the coming years as Germany begins, and many of the large multinationals in Germany begin, to embrace cloud more fundamentally. And so we're positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage of it. And then last thing I'll just reiterate is from the -- as I said a few minutes ago, the governments -- state, regional, local and federal governments in literally Australia, the U.K, other parts of Europe, the U.S. are adopting cloud more aggressively, and that's generating underlying demand for our platform and frankly, the other cloud platforms."

You've probably heard me allude to the bank partnership for a number of months now, but we were delighted to be able to sign the contract at the end of the quarter and release a joint announcement with RBC early in July. Since that time, we've seen the bank really mobilize its sales force and start engaging prospects across the country. And as a result, we're seeing very good growth in RBC's pipeline. Together, we've added a substantial client in July, and we're aiming for more before the end of the quarter."

We are linked to macroeconomic factors, so this correlation with the GDP is very strong. And also, growth in imports. The link to the growth in the GDP, growth in consumption. So with imports growing, the trend is to have a price increase, also an improvement in the mix, better usage, especially the retro area in the port and a good balance between offer and demand. But if we have a growth of the GDP above 2%, which is what we expect this year, the port will have a growth of 10%. 2 years of 10% growth in the port will give us a more balanced situation between offer and demand. And there is a strong demand to slowly recover prices -- prices to recover. I believe this will happen. We've seen signs of the price recovering."

The quarter, for the most part, met our financial expectations as Ultrasound grew 5% on a constant currency basis and Medical Imaging was flat. The one exception, as Jim noted, was our Security segment experienced delay issues leading to a 39% revenue decline, which was the primary cause of the overall 5% revenue drop or 4% on a constant currency basis. The positive news within the quarter was strong gross margin improvement of 3 points driven by favorable product mix and continued cost reductions offset lower revenue volume. Gross margin expansion led to a 2-point improvement on overall non-GAAP operating margin. Now we believe a significant portion of the gross margin improvement is sustainable, but some of the mix benefit may not continue in the second half."

More recently, Canada raised interest rates for the first time since 2010, joining U.S. and 7 other major countries in doing so. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England, too, have hinted at the need to tighten their monetary policies. Meanwhile, IMF in its latest economic update continues to estimate global GDP at 3.5% for 2017. Growth for the Chinese economy appears to be inching up after decelerating for 6 consecutive years.

In particular, it relates to P&I insurance, where the international group has their reinsurance -- part of the reinsurance program placed in the United States. So settlement of potential claims under that insurance coverage could be a challenge. One could not transact in U.S. dollars for one. And now as of late, we've seen also Saudi and Bahrain adding some trade restrictions on ships that have traded in Iran. So there's still issues to be sorted out following some big political decisions and to see if you can make this operational. On the U.S. side, I think there's limited flow for now. There's been some smaller cargoes going out, but there are opening up and the logic, we think, has it that they should export their live-seed products and this should eventually also be good for large tankers that they would need to fully [ph] import some of the more heavier grades for the refineries. So one could expect continued or potentially even increase the import of crude from the Middle East into the United States."

In the Philippines, for the recon investment, which is very small in terms of the operating impact, and in Poland, we have tax credits. We can't utilize tax credits on losses. You just think of it intuitively. So we have to -- when we book a loss, we book no tax offset to that loss. No net operating loss carryforward. So $1 or EUR 1 of pretax loss is the same after-tax. That's causing what appears to be a higher effective income tax rate in the first quarter because it's primarily losses out of Poland. That will swing to a significant tax benefit once we have taxable earnings, which we expect again to have in the second half of the year. So the first quarter tax rate is high because of that technical issue with losses in 2 countries where we have tax credits. Otherwise, we'd be in that 34%, 35% effective tax range."

So in the Navy or Air Guard instead of bringing the ship in to do a 2 to 3 months of upgrade to go attack tomorrow's signals, we're able to have a platform where a lot of small companies as well as ourself can develop new algorithms and rapidly field those.

It will be important to remember that the U.K., which comprises 29% of our revenues, will be recovering from the corona-induced recession at the same time as it negotiates the details of Brexit, which is likely to continue to produce its own economic headwinds in South Africa, from which we derive 11% of our revenues. The current crisis appears to be significantly impacting this already weakened economy, the clearest measure of which is the fact that the rand has devalued 21% in value against the dollar over the past year. In our model, we anticipate bookings and retention rates will be impacted by these economic challenges and note that we have a small number of larger accounts in South Africa currently going through severe economic challenges."

So certainly -- and again, we continue to view that market very favorably, I think, to the point of the strong incomes that those farmer customers are continuing to experience. That tends to be a pretty positive view as we look out even into 2018. Remember, this is a market that we have customers that have remained really pretty profitable even through the downturn.

One is that Venezuela represents around 2% of our net income, the consolidated net income, before it was representing a larger portion, and Venezuela is the one that has the higher effective tax rate closer to 40%. Second is -- point is that as we have the new production plant in Colombia, we have also, it's like a tax-free zone where some of the value-added taxes are 0 or very small. But also, we have a lower income tax number for that -- the company that owns that production plant. And as we are shifting more volume to that plant, our total Colombia effective tax rate is also coming down. And the rest is basically looking for efficiencies in every country in trying to be as efficient as possible that's always complying with laws -- with the tax law in every country, no? But the 2 main impacts is the fact that Venezuela is now a smaller portion of our consolidated number and the fact that this production plant in Colombia has a special treatment with respect to income tax. Going forward, I think that should be -- going forward, just so everyone can be clear, before we were saying that somewhere around 30% was a good effective tax rate. I'll say somewhere around 28%, 29% will be my new expectation going forward."

And you mentioned in particular where it's occurring, Australia, there was -- Australia and Brazil. And the reason I call out those 2 is because they're the major suppliers to China. And with the China slowdown, that has impacted the raw materials and the resources coming from the more heavily mining-centric economies. We also see continued slowness in mining in South Africa. And that has to do a little bit with some of the labor unrest there, but probably a little stronger because of the pricing of the precious metals. Mexico, the mining continues to be strong. Canada, I think, we're having strong sales there, but we do see that slowing as we go forward. So a pretty mixed bag at this point in time with respect to mining.

But that -- absolutely, the full management experience and the security experience on BlackBerry is unmatched. That's the way we look at it at the moment. And as I said, I think Richard asked the question, right now, customers look at us to provide them an end-to-end solution still, and we can't break that paradigm."

Excluding the after-tax impact of the additional 2 items I mentioned, the restructuring charge and the lease settlement, operating net income would've been up 9% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. On that basis, both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were favorably impacted by higher net interest income, a lower loan-loss provision and a lower effective tax rate. And while the fourth quarter was the first quarter to include the full impact of the Bank of Ireland security services and Omnium acquisitions, increasing both revenues and expenses, they were essentially just below breakeven on an operating basis."

The 2 hotels were Seoul and Bishkek, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia, which, combined, impacted our total owned or leased margins by 50 basis points in the quarter. The market-specific issues, very quickly in summary, where in Seoul, new supply, as well as a major competitor coming back after being closed from renovation. And in Bishkek, it is really all demand issues driven specifically by the fact that the U.S. military airbase has been closed down, which was a major contributor to supply of the hotel, customer supply of the hotel."

I think what we've seen is, as the biosimilars entered the market, and it's probably somewhat consistent with the fact that 4 of them entered basically simultaneously. The pricing has been more aggressive, right, which, all along, we've said we would see the biggest impact at launch in that first year, and then it would taper off as we got to the follow-on years. And I think what we've seen play out now only supports that further. So I think you can expect a much bigger impact in 2019 in the countries that had an impact, and then it will slow as we get into 2021. Now there will be countries that come on in the later years, and they'll experience probably a similar kind of curve as we enter those markets.

So just by mentioning this fact, I think that we are all in the beginning of the journey. And if we are going to have the Israel market as the benchmark, and I know that a more visionary goal, the potential growth in Sabra is really big, and we are in the beginning of the journey. Nevertheless, we need to remember that we launched the guacamole product with the salsa product just only 1 year ago. So over there, another way of growing the market.

One, it is -- as Mark said in his prepared remarks, it's addressing the simplification of our organizational structure, which basically means that we're trying to reduce the number of indirect people in the company, and we're trying to simplify by increasing span of controls and reducing unnecessary layers and the unnecessary complexity that is related thereto. The second one is the improvement of the labor mix, which is also, as Mark said, moving activities where possible and faster into the low-cost countries. And then the third one was that we want to do a better job in maximizing our global infrastructure in terms of where we are and what locations we are and the utilization of those locations. So that's the MAP. And as Mark said, that also, of course, has a benefit to CRS. In addition, to this, of course, we do also have other productivity programs in the company. And as Joe referred to earlier, one of them has to be, for instance, the people we took on board last year now get to the learning curve, where their availability is similar to the availability we expect from all our employees in that type of business. And if you assume that the growth that we are guiding for, for the rest of the year is materializing, and as Mark said, the headcount is rather trending down, you will then see a leverage effect of that, that is in addition to the MAP."

And at least when looking at company valuations, that trend appears to have started already. Now building on all of that, what are your thoughts on how all this will play out over the next few years?

Firstly, at the moment, we feel we've built -- we are building a great foundation for the company, whether it's on our margin improvement program, whether it's our focus on cash. We think we've got a nice foundation, and we've got a nice structure to grow in. And Yuval is taking us into new markets and obviously, in power, there are many, many new markets we can go into. We have to be selective and not be all things to all people. But at the same time, in both businesses, we will be utilizing cash to grow the business. So before I used to say, we are starting to look at acquisitions. Year 2 of our strategic plan, we need to grow our revenue base. We need to position ourselves for year 3, and that will mean utilizing some of our cash, hopefully. Little bit -- we have to be realistic here to grow the top line and get us into new markets. So what I think you're going to see is Yuval pushing into new markets organically, or you're going to see Gordon pushing into new countries in effect, slowly, carefully. We don't want to get bloody noses. And at the same time, we're going to layer on top of that acquisitions. And we can do that because we've now got a decent foundation from which to grow from.

So at least for the foreseeable future, yes, we see those margins being sustained. The only downside we may see on that in the short term is that we're spending money on the $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 at Bombardier, which affect those margins in that group. But despite that, I think our margins are, in fact, sustainable. In Aerospace Systems, again, we're working on execution and controlling costs. And there might -- there's pressure on those margins, there's no doubt about that on existing programs, especially some of the military programs. But we think they're substantially sustainable, I mean we might have some hiccups here and there but I doubt it."

Given persistent concerns surrounding further economic weakness in Europe, questions about the sustainability of economic recovery in the U.S., the upcoming U.S. presidential election and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain cautious going into 2012. We are, however, encouraged by the sales pipeline activity and conversion rates from certain existing and new clients within the Americas and EMEA regions. Areas of demand include financial services, communications, healthcare and transportation verticals. However, the underlying run rate demand among subset of clients is expected to remain sluggish. That, along with tough year-over-year comparisons due to programs that generated revenues last year, but are now end-of-life is expected to more than offset the pace of new business. Revenue comparisons between 2012 and 2011 are also expected to remain skewed as 2011, included approximately $24 million in revenue contribution from South Africa, Ireland, and the Netherlands, which the company is expected to exit as part of the previously-announced strategic actions. Furthermore, we expect roughly $15 million in unfavorable foreign currency impact to 2012 revenues relative to 2011. Separately, 2012 quarterly revenues are anticipated to exhibit seasonality, particularly a weaker second quarter relative to the first quarter due to fewer workdays resulting from public holidays. We believe that 2012 to 2011 quarterly revenue comparisons should turn favorable in the fourth quarter of 2012."

But China to the U.S. is increasing, and that's kind of a paradox because you would think that this trade war would be working 2 ways. And we're scratching our heads, quite frankly, a little bit in terms of why that is happening. And I think one of the possible explanations can be, if you speak to the container lines, actually you're seeing a little bit of the same impact on container volumes. And some people in the container industry feels that the explanation could be that if the Chinese government tells the Chinese corporations not to buy U.S. products anymore, they will stop doing it. But if the U.S. economy asks Walmart, \"Don't buy products in China,\" Walmart's going to say, \"Well, we're going to continue buying it as long as it makes economic sense.\" So there's probably less control in terms of shutting off that import. Whether that's actually the case or not, it's really hard to find out. But the fact of the matter is that you are actually seeing increased trade from China to U.S. on some commodities. So the bottom line is for the trade war, at least as it is now, and it also seems to be trailing off a little bit, cooler heads are prevailing, but we do not see a major impact from the trade wars on the chemical tanker demand as it is today."

Actually, we don't think the weather -- well, we think that the weather had very little impact on our second quarter performance and again, we think the timing of our January price increase may have masked the impact from weather. Certainly, while a good portion of the U.S. experienced severe weather that limited construction, we believe our shipments didn't suffer much since our distributors received shipment of the orders that they placed earlier in the quarter. Relative to weather, we actually think that we could see maybe a little impact from weather in our -- in the third quarter as weather could impact the timing of our distributor sales and reorder. In fact, we think that weather impeded construction in April and that could even spill a little bit into early May. We know that in parts of the Northeast and the Midwest, there are still load restrictions on heavy construction equipment and then there's flooding in other parts of the country. So really, I think that the weather could impact how quickly distributors turn their inventory this quarter once delayed projects are released. But since we had this pull forward of orders, since we were able to ship them and our distributors were willing to take them, we probably didn't have much of a weather impact in the second quarter."

But we're really kind of -- we're supplementing that with a lot of new team members, and those folks have been able to move some portfolios over. And so for us, I think net-net, we still feel very good about our ability to grow. If you get a little bit of economic tailwind, then yes, I think we could hit the higher end of the range. But for us, just trying to stay a little bit conservative on our forecasting, we're probably thinking more in that 6%, give or take line."

That was just a tough quarter down there. I mean, clearly, economic issues across the region and then in Brazil, in particular, not only the economic issues but political issues and even the Zika virus is probably causing some concern down there. So I mean, that was the toughest region for us. We actually felt like transition was smooth given some of the remapping that occurs in a transition and the fact that sales cycles often take from anywhere from 6 to 9 months.

Northern Europe, where certainly in all of Europe, we're expecting growth but particularly Northern Europe. South and Latin America continues to outperform. So I think all of our geographical markets were performing well, and we would expect them to share in that strong level of growth that we have, again, not everyone at the same level.

That's why in essence, I actually was not driven necessarily by Salt, but clearly the ability to drive the consolidation ourselves and to not be on the defense line is better. And as I've said before, we have, and you know that because there were so many rumors over the last 2 years, there have been earlier discussions, and we feel now is the time, right, because we are in an excellent position overall. Secondly, there is a lot of transformation going on in the Swiss market. We believe that they allow us to capture more momentum and more possibilities.

So it's a pretty, pretty high proportion on the next tier of people that are maybe national, maybe not internationally known. I think we've worked with a good percentage of those. So -- and the other thing to remind you, the sales guys are going to be out there soon once the product's approved. Right now, we've had an MSL team on the ground since last fall. And they really have worked with probably the top several hundred investigators and KOLs across the country to really make sure their questions are answered about the product, and that they have been very instrumental in channeling ISTs that people are proposing and other indications or earlier lines of therapies.

If you look at our backlog now, it is primarily commercial plus these military contracts that I mentioned in my script. Those are all rebuilds of past work.

We've also seen in-store promotions continued to tick along. So I would describe the overall competitive environment to be relatively neutral for the last 6 to 9 months.

Now we've all certainly seen the headlines of Lidl and Walmart in certain pockets of the country, and that doesn't really impact Sprouts.

I mean, as I think about 2014 in terms of how we kind of originally envisioned it and how it's played out, I think that our original thought was this would be a year in which we'd feel, as we described, a significant ACA impact in places like California and Nevada, which were Medicaid expansion states; in California, which had a robust commercial exchange program, et cetera. But what surprised us, I think, was the really strong performance in Texas that I think, for the most part, is not ACA related, and even the really strong performance in California that I think is beyond the ACA impact. So I mean, that's the sort of geographic kind of trends that -- or differences that I would point out. But I will say that for the most part, the trends that we described are trends that we're really seeing across all of our markets.

I wonder if you'd care to comment on the drivers of the differential between your performance and that of your competitors, particularly with respect to how much of the 5-point gap between you and your peers is a result of you just having to yield on price to maintain volume as your portfolio ages? How much is a consequence of you losing accounts or losing volume to your peers? And how much of it is really a factor of your geographic mix, where you may happen to be overexposed in weaker markets? And the reason I ask is, it really -- it goes to our confidence that, with some new products, you'll be able to recover this business quickly. If it's just price you're having to yield in the short term, one would think that new products would allow you to get that back but if you are losing whole accounts, then you're dependent on winning those back, which is always a bigger task. Or if it's a geographic mix effect, then you're kind of reliant on the market conditions picking back up and new products will help but they certainly might not drive as quick a recovery.

Last night, we reported a record Q4 that resulted in full year revenue and EPS that exceeded our expectations. These results were driven by strategic investments we made throughout the year in domestic demand generation, China go-to-market improvements, technology supporting connectivity, navigation and mapping, advancements in product quality, exploring adjacent Home Robot markets and supporting demand generation efforts of our overseas partners. We also took steps to become more focused on the large home market and to fuel future growth. We created better nuanced messaging of Roomba, driving sell-through and further adoption, successfully launched our first connected robot, Roomba, using vSLAM navigation to dynamically create and update maps. We reallocated R&D resources from the next-generation Remote Presence platform to home opportunities. We began to reinvigorate overseas Home Robot growth, and we identified potential acquirers for our Defense & Security business. As a result of these efforts, Home Robot revenue grew more than 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by sales in the United States and China, which were up 46% and more than 70%, respectively, over Q4 in 2014.

In the near term, we expect e-commerce volumes to remain elevated, although perhaps moderated somewhat from what we experienced in the second quarter. In July, we again saw marketplace GMV exceed $1 billion and eclipse December 2019 levels, our fourth such consecutive month, although down about 8% compared to the average monthly GMV levels we saw in the second quarter. However, despite this modest deceleration compared to the second quarter, we still saw average daily GMV well above pre-COVID levels through the month of July. For comparison, July GMV was up 40% compared to July 2019, even though Amazon Prime Day occurred in July last year and has been postponed this year. Whether this strength in GMV we saw in July continues into August and September is difficult to predict, and with potential new flare-ups of COVID-19 in various geographic regions and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, it remains difficult to know how things will play out over the next few months, particularly the fourth quarter. For these reasons, we're going to stick with shorter-term floor guidance for the time being.

We've used Texas A&M extensively to analyze potential suppliers, probably 60 to 75 different supply points around the country. Some work, some don't work, and some work a little better than others, and so that's what we would consider to be very confidential to the facility. I anticipate that the Darling system will supply somewhere between 50% and 70% of the volume to it, and then from there, it will be outsourced to whatever is the most favorable feedstock, both in the form of quality and price."

China in total as an end market is somewhere around 3% of our total revenues, a little bit less than that as far as an earnings perspective.

On a sequential basis for Q2 '20, revenues were higher by $1.9 million or an increase of approximately 3%. The higher revenues were driven by PMP products, which grew 16% quarter-over-quarter due to service providers scaling networks driven by request for increased capacity and better-than-anticipated field deployments. Q2 '20 revenue growth was offset by lower demand for PTP products with revenues lower by 4% sequentially due to the timing of U.S. federal programs, which are expected to materialize during Q3 '20.

Was there any commonality to it? And then, Mike, you went through some pace by product type a little quickly, but when you look across the entire business, is there anything, whether it's product type, sub-markets, geography, I don't know, if it's attached, detached -- are there any common things when you look at where the sales pace is declining that you can say, \"Hey, this is one area that we're keeping an eye on,\" or is it just too diverse of a dynamic at this point?

As stated in the press release, as a result of our strong first-half results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our previously announced earnings per share estimate for the full year of 2010 of $3.93 to $4, which is an increase of 13% to 15%, excluding plant restructuring charges and the favorable litigation settlement with Abbott. As I predicted at this year’s CAGNY conference, 2010 will be an ugly year, driven by weak consumer demand, rising commodity prices, increased pressure from the retailers and competitive price wars. But when things get ugly, you should place your bets on the company that has the product portfolio that thrives in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth. That company is Church & Dwight."

As Scott pointed out, in the third quarter, there was some softness in demand, both because of underlying economic issues and also some unusual weather patterns which is why we said we think inventory is a little bit higher than normal for this time of the year in the channel. With that said, these markets have been, the southern European markets and northern Africa markets, where we've had political or financial uncertainty, have been uncertain for some time. So we don't see a compelling reason to see demand being further weakened from these levels. We are going into the off-season, so it will be choppy through the end of the year and into the first quarter next year until we see the seasonality kick in. But overall, again, we're a very large replacement business. We're continuing to expand our distribution in Europe, through the Middle East with the acquisition of Impo.

There is also a onetime tax-related items that reduced the tax rate by about 3%. So we're still consistent with our guidance that, assuming the current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we would anticipate a effective tax rate between 35% and 40%. If you unwind the 3% to a onetime impact in the third quarter, that takes you up to 35%. And if you look at year-to-date, our effective tax rate is about 37%.

You are fully right that there is some discussion happening in a number of countries about a long-term potential ban and that's the first comment I would have, is I do anticipate there will be a continued discussion on this, because typically, of course, banning one technology is not necessarily always the best option. I think that the target of reducing CO2 output is very clear, of reducing emissions. And hopefully, there will be approaches where the steering is exactly towards that target, of reducing and minimizing emissions. So I anticipate still quite a lot of debate, whether banning one technology is the right approach, or whether it's more, just putting far tougher and tougher ambition on the regulation is a better approach. Then also allowing other technologies, other alternative fuel solutions to come into play. The other comment I would make is that, of course, it's also good to note that the discussion is very much around passenger cars. It is roughly 30% of the oil demand. So it's also important to note that the growing segments of heavy-duty aviation chemicals bunker date. They continue to be very important for us and we focus of course on those also a lot."

We've proven year in, year out that we could make money on that. You look at the strength of the West Coast of Florida. Of all the areas in this country, it probably is among the strongest because the people going there are older and they have money and they're less affected by this, and that's going to continue. It's got a tremendous history. So the combination of that, the breadbasket, the feed we can bring to it from where we fly, all the markers are incredibly strong. So while we're not going to put any capital into it at this point in time, longer term, as a strategy, I think that what we're embarked on is a diversification that's second to none in the industry. And we've got a great head start with that asset. So we certainly want to stay involved in some fashion to feed ourselves and continue to enhance third-party revenues. So that's a good strategic overview."

They cannot change it because there is a lot of investments in the country. And the possibility of Indonesia will be in the end up. The Indonesian ban is forcing people to invest in Indonesia. If the Philippines do the same, we'll have more nickel pig iron. In Indonesia or Philippines, we'll have more sources of nickel, more nickel available and this nickel would be available and open to the rest of the world. Until now, we complained about nickel pig iron because it was a material that only was produced and consumed in China. And they couldn't export because of the export duties in China. Something that, by the way, we are trying to eliminate in the World Trade Organization. But, anyway, if they produce nickel pig iron, if the Chinese producers go to Indonesia or go to Philippines to produce nickel pig iron, this material, this raw material will be open for the rest of the world. So more source of nickel, more nickel available and open to the market."

Now our analysis of the DoD's fiscal 2012 budget request, which was released just two weeks ago, indicates the continuing strength of our business. In fact, funding for the budget line items that support most of our work should remain relatively stable. This includes $204 billion for the operation and maintenance line item.  That's an 11% increase over 2010. It also includes $75 billion for the research, development, test and evaluation line item.  That's another important source of funding for our continuing work for the DoD. These funding levels are consistent with the DoD's commitment to using service contractors for highly-specialized technical and engineering services, firms like us. Budget cuts are more likely to affect major weapons acquisitions programs and contractors that provide personnel augmentation rather than the technical services that we provide."

So we don't really think it's a share activity. We think it was primarily solar. And that's pretty well behind us because we've burned off the year-to-year adjustments in that regard.

We're comfortable with our guidance as far as the range, but they could swing fairly wildly because some of it is new conquest business, right? It's not carryover business. So those have a significant impact on us. The second item is we're going through the third quarter where you have customer shutdowns, and although they say one thing, they may behave another way, and that could be plus or minus. There's uncertainty on shutdowns. And then the third I would like to point out, James talked about just the general uncertainty.

We anticipate continued strength in biodiesel fuel and renewable diesel fuel shipments due to an increase in market demand for renewable fuels. We also expect tight truck capacity, combined with the value of rail, to continue our penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and beverage business."

Our revised full year targets are as follows: Our sales will be approximately $6.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $950 million to $975 million and adjusted free cash flow will be approximately $175 million. The most significant update from our previously disclosed targets relates to the estimated impact of the GM work stoppage. While we began to feel the impact of the work stoppage in the third quarter of 2019, its impact will be exponentially greater in the fourth quarter of 2019. Not only were we impacted for nearly the entire month of October but the breadth of the impact of the work stoppage expanded geographically during the fourth quarter.

Budgets are going to be changing. They're going to be more closely scrutinized in the process to close transactions.

I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.  However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree to sector, in general, we'll see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO."

We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins and do it all in a capital-efficient approach. SFS 2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. And today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum."

As I already mentioned, the truck market, especially in Europe, could recover because some of the supply chain issues were resolved. There's still some concerns in Europe, obviously, due to the conflict and other items. But supply chain situation for the truck customer has improved considerably and with that, we have the 23% growth in the truck industry.  In trailers, 1% growth. There, we had a strong market already in the last year. So it continues to be on a high level. The tractor markets contracted by 8%, mainly impacted due to uncertainties of energy and rising costs and also some supply chain issues.  In that environment, JOST had an 18% growth, benefiting mainly from the recovery in the truck market and a good performance also in the other market segments."

For the full year fiscal '13 over fiscal 2012, also about 1 point in headwind. Now that's improved versus our Security Analyst Meeting when it was 2 points of headwind. But you -- you kind of alluded to it, we really need to think about the fact that HP is exposed to a whole basket of currencies. And we have different hedging strategies depending on the competitive business that we're in. And so, for example, in the services space, we hedge longer term than we do on a purely transactional business -- piece of business in the Personal Systems Group. It also depends on how quickly we can pass on changes in currency and pricing. And so that basket of currency and then the different hedging strategies really mutes the kind of the currency impact quarter-to-quarter in our business. From a supplies perspective, the depreciation in the yen didn't give as much of a benefit in Q2. It's more skewed to the second half and mostly in Q4 when we see the big ramp and that's really because of the contract that we have with Canon and the hedges that we had in place at the point of time that the yen started to depreciate. We do expect that our cost savings in the second half are creating quite a war chest for Japanese competitors and we're starting to see a more aggressive pricing. They now have a lower cost structure than they did before."

Big country, loving American brands, but we have to make sure that our brand -- because a lot of new brands are coming into China, and every time something comes in, that is the bright shiny object. So keeping our name front and center and really putting money behind marketing has been a strategic call we've made, probably a little greater dollar investment than we envisioned 2 years ago when we first put this on a piece of paper, but we are getting the benefit of brand awareness. And if we weren't getting that, we'd be the first people, because most people in the call know us well, that we would not be advocating and telling everybody we're going to open 30 stores in 2012 if we didn't feel the acceptance of the brand.

We have seen this continuous overperformance in almost all markets driven by, for instance, in China because we indicated in China, sales or volume development, relatively weak. On the passenger and commercial vehicle side, it's actually declined this year. Still, the tighter emission regulations in those markets like China, like in India, which started stage 6, a key driver for an increased share of volatility because the client base in these development countries are more and more looking for Engineered Joining Technology rather than using a scotch tape or a paper tape because they recognize that the emission regulations can only be met with a fully fledged assortment of joining technology. And that's exactly where we are coming in. That's exactly where our engineering teams are helping our customers to meet that tighter emission regulations. And that is one of the key drivers of our overperformance relative to market growth. And of course, the backlog scenario supports that view, as you pointed out, double-digit backlog growth versus the year 2017, which indicates that despite of relatively weak production as well as GDP numbers as well as the overly indicated trade barriers. And certainly, that supports volatility. And volatility, normally, is never good for growth. But we see that underlying growth drivers in the mega trends, be it water management or tighter emission regulations, as the key for our growth trajectory."

Are we worried about the potential exercise of political influence, and what criteria will we use to evaluate nonorganic growth in Spain? From Fidentiis we have a question about the conditions in which we'd be willing to take part in the consolidation of the Spanish financial system. From Daiwa, we have a question about our estimate for the composition of our earnings coming from the different regions in the next 3 years.

As I said earlier, we continue to watch developments in Washington closely, as new legislation around biomedical devices and IoT seem very likely. We are already assisting several clients with managing the risk to their biomedical devices as well as business associates who produce and supply these critical assets. We are working now on a biomedical device security offering using the lessons learned from these experiences. This quarter, we are very pleased with the success of our new service lines launched earlier this year. The first example is our vendor security management service. The third-party vendors to our customers are an increasing threat to their enterprise. Many times, our customers do not possess the expertise in manpower to proper vet and manage the risks those suppliers pose to the data and systems that they manage for the hospital. This is also another example of where our integration efforts are beginning to pay off. By upgrading and integrating the software from the Delphiis acquisition, we now have a software-as-a-service-based solution, called RiskSonar, that allows us to take on the entire vendor security management process for our clients, bringing up their teams to focus on other core areas around risk management."

You have here on the left-hand side the corporate portfolio is EUR 326 billion of the total EAD, approximately 1/3, and you can see that there is no high concentration of problematic sectors. Although, obviously, as you would expect, most of our provisioning is around some specific sectors, such as oil and gas, shipping, aircraft. We have little exposure to LBOs, less than EUR 5 billion. And as we already said that with Diony a few months ago, we have a very strict discipline in terms of structures in LBOs and underwriting commitment so that we can come back on that later. And on retail, we have a very well-diversified geographical exposure. And let me stress the fact that as far as mortgages are concerned or home loans are concerned in countries such as France, which is where we have the bulk of our mortgages, you have the high securities through insurance schemes.

Clearly, from a day-to-day running of the operation, I would peg the need to be in the $50 million to $75 million range and probably, from a security perspective, just a peace of mind, probably maintain about $100 million on the balance sheet.

But I can tell you on the frontline, and this is very subjective, the representatives score the leads based on their interpretation of the quality of that, and that is about 5% better than last year. So I do trust their perspective. There's no reason for them to say that it's a higher quality when it's not. Obviously, that translates into their conversion rate.

First of all, there had been widespread changes in governments in countries where they were having difficult problems in achieving their fiscal targets. Secondly, during 2011, we've seen fiscal adjustments and corrections in order to achieve the budget targets by the end of 2013. The measures taken at the end of 2011 by the European Central Bank have clearly lightened the tension in the markets. And with the negotiations on Greek debt coming to an end, it's been possible to bring down the risk premium for peripheral countries bit by bit, and that means a lower interest payment cost for these countries and their banking sectors. The crisis, however, has had an impact on the financial sector, especially on 4 key areas. First of all, capital and liquidity. On the situation of risks, in a very general sense of the word and then the results, the earnings of the sector. And that's where BBVA, yet again, has managed to stand out, outperforming its peers in all these areas. In capital, we're going to comply with the new EBA capital recommendations of 9% capital ratio by June 2012. And by 2012, as we move into 2012, we're already on a very sound financial footing."

Obviously, listen, you're a global company, you've been making investments with the perspective of a multiyear kind of view, which is obviously wise and prudent. But you are dealing with geopolitical headwinds across the border, volatility. How do you think about the investments you've made, particularly in global excellence, particularly in the Eurozone? If we see an increased risk of a breakup there, do you -- is there actions you're going to have to take?

Our adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the fourth quarter. While there are some good signs of performance in the quarter, which we'll talk about in a minute, we also incurred an earlier and more severe level of influenza expense than in prior years, as Ken just mentioned. The more severe early flu season cost us approximately $15 million more than the average of the prior 2 years or $0.22 in the quarter. The vast majority of the flu cost hit us in the month of December in Medicaid and was more prevalent with the CHIP and aged, blind and disabled populations. Our experience matched up with the external markers from a geography standpoint with more severe incidents in Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri. Since December, which appears to be the peak for Medicaid, we have seen a tapering off of flu with respect to the Medicaid population but we have seen a modest uptick in Medicare, which was not a pressure point in the fourth quarter."

New business strain continues to benefit from our efforts to reprice and improve the risk profile of our Insurance businesses.

In volume, the big 5 carry about 50% of the hemophilia market. I would expect that of the total market, they would represent closer to 70% in value. Germany, among the big 5 in volume, is about 1/4. And so it's quite a significant part. And if you look at the relative value of Sweden and Ireland and Scotland, which are the other key markets where we've had access and sales, I may be missing 1 or 2 small markets. But it's together, they would be in the single digits. So I think the proportion of our markets, Germany is as, by far, the largest single contributor and will continue to be. When you look at England, Italy and France and Spain coming on board, then that really brings us from that level of about 25% up to closer to 65%, 70%, I would guess. But I'm saying guess because, while we have very good data on volumes, we have far less good data on values. So it's a lot harder to estimate this specific revenue potential for each country.

We estimate overall that in Q1, in the growth that we are reporting in Q1, the COVID-19 accounts for approximately minus 10 percentage points of growth.

You had mentioned that when this order comes out, you're hoping that everyone is going to, I don't know, I guess, make changes and not face sanctions at the FCC. So if you look at your existing interconnection situation between the ISPs that you think are not investing enough money, is your expectation that there's something in the document that will specifically require them to do something that would lead to sanctions? Or is it more likely that you would have to file a complaint? And can you just talk about what exactly are you going to put in the complaint if that's the process as opposed to what you described as far as some type of sanction for something which I thought was already a complaint process?"

In the 9 months of 2011, the decline of domestic sales volumes has been dramatic, and coupled with the shutdown of export markets in North Africa, has led capacity utilization of our plants to historically low levels. The decline of sales has come across all products and market segments with across-the-board pricing pressures. In general, the increase in uncertainty regarding the political and the economic prospects of the country are severely affecting demand for building materials both in the private as well as in the public sector. In the private sector, continued sharp reductions in employment, a drop in real disposable income and an elevated tax burden on real estate properties discourage construction decisions. Furthermore, lack of credit availability from banks and a still high outstanding stalk of houses for sale weakened the prospects of residential investment stabilization. However, regarding public works, they recently announced agreement with the EU to lower the share of national contribution in order to access structural funds to 5% from 27% previously, is expected to support the recovery in public investment activity going forward. For Titan, productivity initiatives, reduction of SG&A expenses by 13% and sale of excess carbon emission rights supported operational profitability. Turnover declined by 36% to EUR 210.3 million, while EBITDA reached EUR 42.7 million with EBITDA margin standing at 20.3%."

And while the swap activity resulted in additional interest expense in the quarter, the termination actually resulted in a $30 million cash inflow which is reflected in the financing section in the statement of cash flows. So it was a financial benefit from a cash perspective and GAAP accounting required some additional expense. Excluding these swap-related items to the unique items with respect to interest expense, interest expense was up about $1 million in the quarter versus first quarter a year-ago. The tax rate in the quarter was in the 40 to 45% range excluding the unique items and reflects really a geographic mix issue in the quarter compounded by the low level of earnings both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And it is what it is in the quarter, that reflects our actual experience.

We are cautiously optimistic about 2017 based on the order entry we are seeing in recent weeks and the fourth quarter growth in select end markets, particularly consumer electronics and industrial components. Also as I mentioned earlier, we believe the oil and gas market has troughed and is poised for modest recovery in 2017. However, there continues to be uncertainty regarding geopolitical events and the U.S. policy with the new presidential administration. The ultimate impact of these events and/or policy changes on the U.S. and global economy is difficult to predict."

Now if I exclude again the incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again reflecting our strong stations, as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter, and as we all know, pacing can be volatile. So stay tuned, and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses."

But according to us, the Indian production will be about 34.5 million to 35 million bales. And with the opening stock of 3.6 million bales as on 1st October, 2018 and with the import of 1.5 million bales, consumptions of 32 million bales, export of 4.5 million bales, the total take off will be about 36.5 million bales. Ending stock will be about 3.1 million bales. So there will be a reduction in stock or this is the possible the country may export more cotton. Already [ 22.5 ] million bales have already been exported from the country up to 31st January, 2019. And this 4.5 million bales export we are taking on the very conservative side. If there is a more export, then there will be further reduction in the stock. This is all about the international situation and as far as the Indian cotton situation is concerned. But if we compare the cotton prices, which were prevailing in the month of December, January and February year '17, '18 versus this year and looking to the dollar-rupee relationship at that time with range of $0.63 to $0.64 -- INR 64, in terms of U.S. cents, this year the cotton is competitively cheaper, one.

And during that period, the impact of customer defaults for the last 5 years for AerCap has averaged less than 60 basis points of revenue. That's the net impact. So I am sure we will see customer defaults, but what you have seen in the past time and again from AerCap, is that the collateral package we have, the global reach of our platform has enabled us to come out of these situations with a minimal impact and move the aircraft rapidly to the follow-on lessee.

We view our strong capitalization as a cushion for what is a turbulent region, and we're very happy that we have that. At the same time, that turbulence is what creates opportunity for us. While local players get thrown off by the changing environment in the countries every time that a crisis ensues, and the big financial players, international players, shy away from emerging markets and the region whenever there are these type of uncertainties, Bladex is always there and can spot the opportunities and act accordingly. So having the strong capitalization enables us to both weather the storm or the bad weather, whatever -- in whatever form it comes, and it also allows us to capitalize on the opportunity that is created from a higher-margin, lower-liquidity environment.

From our side, we are making the company far more efficient, far more productive, far more conscious of costs, far more conscious of premiums, far more conscious of the new position which we have taken in the marketplace. And we think that though immediate future may be a little clouded, we don't know how it's going to pan out, just like the way you are having Nisarga right now, little cloudy. But we think that we will be -- we will emerge from this significantly leaner, significantly stronger, significantly improved performance."

The U.S. property and casualty companies within the U.S. tax group, although incurring material underwriting losses due to the catastrophic events discussed previously, had these losses overshadowed by a gains emanating from our U.S. mortgage unit. This put the U.S. tax group in a taxpaying position, even though the company overall sustained operating losses. The underlying effective annual tax rate grew to 19% even for the year for the same basic reason, which is a lower level of estimated full year operating income than was forecast as of last quarter. The increase in the estimated effective annual tax rate causes the first 2 quarters of 2017 to be reevaluated at this now higher rate, and this impact reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. Therefore, this tax adjustment is directly derivative from the catastrophic loss estimates. And as a reminder, our tax rate is affected by varying mixes of income by geographical distribution and any associated changes on local tax rates. As for after-tax operating income earnings per share accretion realized in the third quarter from the UGC acquisition, we examined our results with and without the impact to the acquisition and the accretion remains consistent with past quarters and continues to move towards the initial 35% target."

Excluding the impact of this adjustment, gross profit margin was 34.7%, an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year. The increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters, a favorable overall organic product mix, primarily due to a higher sales mix of residential products in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year, and the favorable impact of gross margin from the acquisition of Country Home Products.

International sales continued to decline partly on the back of adverse general economic settings like in Greece and partly on the back of negative currency impact in many countries. The gross profit on sales increased as did the gross profit margin. Operating earnings were up. Working capital strongly improved.

In opening remarks, you said that the performance is strong and you consistently show now profitability of around 30%, both last year and this year.

You referenced political risk, but perhaps you could maybe follow up on that and comment on what would you need to really see for you to be more comfortable to grow in the country?

First, the accelerator mission allows for reciprocal data rights back to UrtheCast, which, in turn, allows for SAR-XL data sales revenues much earlier than would otherwise have been the case and allows for building the customer base for OptiSAR data in advance of the constellation being launched. Secondly, the accelerator mission or missions significantly derisks OptiSAR technologically, financially and programmatically. Thirdly, at this time, UrtheCast's management and board believe that a pushout in the anticipated or target date for OptiSAR is prudent, in large part because that reflects the reality of the situation with the customers and also the reality of implementing a stand-alone SAR program as described. Fourth, the accelerator mission will provide UrtheCast with more time to sign further contracts and to arrange for the necessary export credit and project financing. Fifth, the accelerator mission will send what we think is a very significant signal to prospective OptiSAR customers that the technology and the program are real and that they significantly boost our credibility for being able to execute and deliver on programs of this scale.

But we should see some improvement to our cost structure with 8 pesos to the $1. What we're evaluating is what is that impact on inflation. I don't mean to dominate the answer -- the time with an answer to this question, but Argentina is an important country to discuss, the issues are important to discuss. What we're considering is when we look at an inflation rate in the country at the present level, when we see the currency devalue from 6 pesos to 8 pesos to the $1, is the inflation already baked into an expectation that the currency would go to 8 pesos to the $1 dollar. Our expectation is that over the intermediate and longer term, the answer is yes. There might be some short term movement in inflation, upward movement in inflation. But we think that what the local marketplace was pricing when the peso is 6 pesos to the $1 was when it's inflation rate was in anticipation that the peso would devalue, and that devaluation would go to 8 pesos to $1."

We see a market where compliance requirements continue to increase and where cyber threats continue to evolve and exploit multiple business communication channels. We see a market where companies increasingly leverage the cloud, and their employees do even more work on mobile devices. Whether at social media, mobile, audio, video, e-mail, business customers, both small and large, will require an even more advanced set of tools and solutions to combat security threats and securely retain the communications data necessary to protect their businesses."

Considering the number of identities an enterprise may need to manage, each of which may be accessing a myriad of applications with varying levels of permissions, a typical global enterprise could easily have millions of points of access into their systems. Each of these represents a point of exposure. And if just one access point is breached, it can compromise the entire organization. In addition to this very real security concern, organizations are also wrestling with the growing compliance requirements facing their businesses. And new regulations that focus more on privacy, like the general Data Protection Act, are shining a light on a growing area of risk, data, including private personal information, and sensitive corporate information, including financial reports and intellectual property. SailPoint's vision has always been to manage the digital identities of all users, such as employees, contractors, business partners and even bots and devices across all applications whether running in a data center or in the cloud and all data whether in structured applications or stored in files."

Over the last 14 months, as our larger, more sophisticated customers become more reliant on our deployment delivery model staff aug and viewing it competitively against project consulting and offshoring, they've been deciding to spend more of their annual budgets on staff aug than offshoring, especially with the uncertainty about immigration reform. You got to remember that these bills have been introduced both by the Democratic members of the house as well as the Republicans. And so this is something they can probably agree to. So what we've seen early on is even before there is any change in the law that certain customers are hedging their bets and not being as dependent on newer projects being executed on those deployment models versus domestic deployment models."

The response to that in the market has created an illiquidity in our -- on our position, and we're trying to assess how that effects the stock.

We agree with you that the yield is not reflective of where we think the stock should be or the units -- the price should be.

Just wanted to know if you've seen any sequential decline or flattening in pricing in your D&I and Utilities cables from the level we've seen in Q3, Q4 last year? That's question number one. The question number two is on Brazil. I think last year already in Q1, you had some weak Q1. Just wanted to know if it was that some kind of seasonality that you've seen in Brazil? Or is it just like a some weakening demand in that market and in general? So just remind us the level of possibility of that country for Utilities cables compared to the rest of the division."

As has been discussed, Q2 was a quarter significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the associated governmental shelter in place orders put into effect across the country. While we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic, we believe approximately $23 million to $24 million in FFOM was lost due to situations surrounding the pandemic this quarter. Overall, owned property revenue was $32.4 million, negatively impacted by COVID related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt and waived fees and other items. Somewhat offsetting the lost revenue, owned property operating expenses were $8 million lower than originally budgeted as we were able to reduce spend in each area, except for the uncontrollables of insurance and property taxes. As a result of the lower-than-originally-budgeted property NOI, ground lease expense was approximately $500,000 less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners, and joint venture partners' non-controlling interest and earnings was approximately $1.2 million lower. Additionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1 million lower and FFOM contribution from our on-campus participating properties was also almost $800,000 lower due to universities refunding a portion of spring rents at properties in both of these business segments. Lastly, we were able to create approximately $800,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan for the quarter. ."

The Central Bank of Sudan decided to set its daily currency exchange rate using a newly formed body of bankers and exchange bureaus effective October 7, 2018. This resulted in an official exchange rate being set at SDG 47.5 to $1. The official exchange rate before that was SDG 28 to $1. This has the possibility also of causing hyperinflation in the country. We are looking at this, and we are waiting to see the annual 2018 price index to determine the impact of this in a reasonable certainty."

If you recall last year, we also had some political gridlock that was making some noise in the economy. But when we track the tonnage per day, particularly of freight through the month of October -- and you're correct, last year, we saw a decline in our tonnage per day on a sequential basis in October, we saw the exact same thing occur this year. So it's really hard for us to determine is this a new seasonality, or is it the effect of similar confluence of events around political gridlock that's happen to cause the same impact in our businesses? We don't know the answer to that at this point."

From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that is set to expire on December 9 of this year.

If you look at what the euro average fourth quarter of last year to this year, you would expect a bit of a headwind. I'm going to say probably $2 million or $3 million just related to translation on the European results. The rest of it is really cross currency exposures. Again, not generally terribly significant, but in the quarter we saw some movements that actually drove it up. I mean, our cross-currency exposures, the South African rand to both the euro and the dollar will have an impact. And as precious metals move, the rand tends to move differently against the euro and the dollar. We do have a bit of exposure between the euro and the yen, because we actually export some ride control product into Japan for vehicles that are manufactured there. Euro and the Eastern European countries will have an impact on us. That was, I think, fairly small in the quarter, but a little bit.

While this change is simply a historical and prospective geographic shift, we believe this change will give the investment community a better framework for analyzing our spread-based business model. To supplement this change, we also are now disclosing an adjusted operating ROA or return on assets measure, which we think will also help analyze our operating earnings in a spread-based context. Lastly, to provide even more transparency around the strong credit quality of our asset portfolio, we've included in the financial supplement new information on a credit quality of total invested assets as well as the largest components of our structured securities portfolio."

Tooling sales declined slightly compared to a year ago and had a negative effect of 1% on the top line growth. From a geographic standpoint, our European operations represented approximately 56% of sales this year versus 59% of sales in the prior year, while our U.S. operations accounted for 27% of sales versus 26% last year."

And so that does have a major impact, I wouldn't say it's regulatory. It's recommended through some of the endoscopy associations and sterilization organizations.

And I think what this represents is, when you have a portfolio in ankle that says, you're really the or one of the top 2 or 3 players in that area, and the fact that ankle is probably the fastest subsegment growth within extremities, that's really the combination which is driving it. And I would say, the second part to that I was alluding to is, is we're starting to get the formula worked out here for how to get more products out on a real time basis, and not just for the U.S., but getting them out globally. And I think to Glenn's point, the Cadence rollout is a good example of that. If you can come up with a new product with the right type of global input, and within an 18-month period, get it out to about 15  to 20 countries, obviously, the ramp-up impact is significantly higher than taking 5 years to do it, U.S. first. And that's some of the benefit that we're starting to see. I think on the SSS side, when you look at CUSA Clarity, it's another good example of feedback from markets all around the world, factoring in feature changes, ergonomic needs and then being able to actually launch that product simultaneously around the world, will create greater and faster ramp-ups than we've seen in previous product launches."

But as I said on an earlier comment, I don't know that you should expect what's happened in oil prices recently to have a very near-term effect on the international countries that we operate in."

First, security threats are becoming more complex. As a result, security intelligence organizations find it more difficult to detect, investigate and neutralize threats and are seeking new data mining solutions. Second, there is a shortage of data scientists and cyber analysts, and security organizations are seeking advanced automation capabilities to perform functions previously performed by humans. And third, security organizations are looking for predictive intelligence as a force multiplier. Predictive intelligence is generated by correlating massive amounts of data from a wide range of disparate sources to uncover previously unknown connections, identify suspicious behaviors and predict future events."

Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and Emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related. We believe the majority of the slowdown in the emerging markets has been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrops and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets."

Although the global economy is poised to improve this year, we remain aware and very alert to the potential threats represented by the greater emphasis on protectionism and economic nationalism and the heightened geopolitical risks.

So it's actually lower than our target of 95%. It's early days, first quarter. But we have provisioned EUR 30 million in Belgium for those claims resulting out of the terrorist attacks. And that is quite conservative. Probably, you know that the terrorist attacks in Belgium are settled via a fund, funds for terrorist attacks. And that fund is picking up the first EUR 300 million -- or actually, it's financed, the first EUR 300 million, by the insurance industry. We have made the reservation for the full amount, EUR 300 million, plus taking into account our market share, which is about 10%. So that's the EUR 30 million coming from.

We had also pulled down spends quite a bit because there was unavailability of stock and the country was disrupted.

What we had decided in the last 3 [ph] months is to invest in the security and to use the -- to reduce the risk for our shareholders in terms of floating rates thereby increasing our fixed rate to 60% and so investing in duration in our fixed rate as a duration of 5 years.

First, we issued our inaugural Green bond, raising $500 million of 7 year debt at 2.7%. Welltower's ESG team, led by Kirby Brendsel, put a lot of time and effort in preparing for the reporting requirements that come with Green bond financing and is paid off with tremendous support received from ESG investors. Welltower is committed to staying at the forefront of ESG initiatives and we look forward to growing this part of our capital stack going forward."

And then the other areas of our business is then much, much smaller, especially the equity placement and the loan sales. I mean this is obviously something which is very relevant for us going forward because if I move just quickly to the U.K., in an environment where the owners of buildings in the U.K. are unwilling to kind of lower their price expectations, whereas the buyers have an ambition to kind of get a premium for buying into the U.K. market in that political uncertainty, the transaction volumes in the U.K. have been down very, very significantly. HFF came with a very strong debt business in the U.K. And if you don't sell at some point in time, you have to refinance, which is very attractive in that interest rate environment at the moment. And so that debt business is probably something which will show more growth, not only in the U.S., but also in the U.K. and other areas of the world when volumes on the investment sales side may be slightly muted in a more critical environment."

And the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has dropped another 20 to 30 basis points to around 2.25%. This increased volatility has not had any impact on our operations or leasing activities.

However, the percentage of those courses taken online by those students rose from 71% in 2010 to 75% in 2011, resulting in the slight increase in demand for online courses by military students. Despite minimal market growth and headwinds from the overall environment, APUS experienced 9% growth in net course registrations by students using TA in the year 2011, thereby continuing to increase our market share and cement our position as the leading provider of voluntary education to service members. Even with this growth, active-duty military students represent an increasingly smaller portion of our overall population and growth compared to prior years. Going forward, we believe that a combination of factors may cause military enrollment at AMU to be volatile and possibly decline.

So in unsecured loan, what we see is a drop-down to 30% of what we usually see in unsecured loans. There is some fluctuation. What do we expect is this number will improve in the course of the time when we see somehow a release of these restrictions. This will come, but it takes some time. It's a little bit more difficult country-by-country to understand what is the impact on the secured part. So mortgages difficult to differentiate if there is a backlog from the days before they close down or is it that activities there are significantly higher than in the unsecured loan, but still down from normal times."

So I will comment basically on the gray line, that is basically excluding the exchange rates, where we will see basically the efforts of management and the results of the management of the bank over this quarter. In relation to the first 9 months of 2012, exchange rates explain 2/3 of the fall in gross income and close to half of the decline in net operating income. If we eliminate their impact, gross income declined by 2.9% due to the liquidity buffer, the narrowing of spreads due to the change in the mix toward lower-risk products in some countries, like Brazil, and lower lending volumes. Costs were slightly below or -- the average inflation of the group and low provisions were lower year-on-year. Lastly, the higher attributable profit reflects the impact of large real estate provisions in 2012."

One is normal tuition increases that tend to run 2.5% to 3% and those have been -- as you'll recall, those get booked over time. And as student starts, they start at higher rates and that accrues to the revenue per student. A second impact is as military students kind of flatten out in terms of they've been growing over time, as they flattened out as a percentage of our student mix, that discount that they get, you don't get as much of it. So the flattening of that adds to the revenue per student. And the third major bucket of that is in terms of the mix of students and the length of time they stay in school, the electives that they're taking, the manufacturer-specific training that they're taking as well as some of our CTG revenue.

That matters tremendously in the forward outlook. Principally, in the Caribbean, we've been focused, as you know, on reducing our exposure to higher risk markets through divestitures and active derisking measures in the countries that we remain in. Currently, customer assistance programs are showing improvement in portfolio performance with a significant decrease in early delinquency across the region. We've adjusted our risk strategies to reflect changes in the risk profile and this has been followed by an expansion of customer assistance capabilities based on those increased delinquency volumes. Over the coming months, we expect delinquency levels to be changeable, as the economic impact in the region is expected to last through the end of the year, and this is reflected in our provisioning methodology. But I'd say overall, Nacho (sic) [ Doug ] that we are pleased that our recent divestitures in Central American and Caribbean are complete, and this results in a better risk profile for the region."

New Class 2 and Class 3 models launched in the first half of 2014 are demonstrating significant greater field reliability than prior generation products. Fleet composition is also changing rapidly as a result of our sales growth, and this will have a positive effect on field reliability and labor cost. Today, we have over 5,000 GenDrive units under GenCare service management. A percentage of new models, which represent our most reliable systems, is increasing due to sales growth, while older, early-generation, legacy models are beginning to retire as customers purchase new material handling equipment and refresh their GenDrive fleet. These legacy models represent less reliable systems, coupled with a high replacement part cost due to component and parts obsolescence. Increasing unit volume within a local geographical area also has a positive impact on labor cost, and we are seeing this as more and more sites are being clustered in area. We expect all of these factors to allow our service operating margins to be breakeven by the end of 2015."

So that we're not reliant on any single funding partner. So hence, as a result of that, there's definitely a lack of concentration among our funding sources and funding partners. Regarding the concerns or the potential regulations about local banks potentially not being able to lend outside of their region or region of jurisdiction, it's probably worth pointing out that now as mentioned earlier, we have over 100 institutional funding partners all over the country. We're aware of the potential for such a role, but we also have major national banks who are our funding partners. In addition, we are also in anticipation for any potential changes cultivating relationships with more and more regional banks. So that when and if, and perhaps the emphasis should be on if right now, any new regulations emerge on this front, it will be like other times when new regulations emerge. We should be able to manage it relatively smoothly, if not completely smoothly with limited or even no impact to our underlying business, as has happened in general in the past. So in short, we're prepared. We're prepared for anything that might happen on that front. Now that said, whether the rule will come out or whether there's anything that's being decided or what's the time horizon from that, we haven't heard anything new.

Given where the conflict between the U.S. and China is in commercial terms, there is -- our view is that the U.S. definitely needs Mexico if it wants to remain competitive in its own manufacturing. And the only way you can basically substitute China right now is also if you increase activity in Mexico. So we see that as a core strength of the country. Bear in mind that we're also seeing a lot of activity actually of Asian companies coming into the border towns basically installing fixed capacity in those towns and basically trying to bypass those royalties by also leveraging on the -- on Mexican label, which, as you know, is basically less expensive than that of China. So -- and then on the -- I would say on the headline side of things, what we're basically seeing is also a little bit more a return to pragmatism by the current administration.

We have made a lot of improvements in managing this business.

However, there's also something to look at the macro environment in South Africa, which has not been helping. There has been a negative growth and there is a negative sentiment in the country.

What we need to understand, meaning that, what is the regulation per state around casinos and VLTs, and each state has a current reality on this. What we need to understand and what the market is starting to understand is that the game, Sports Betting, is bigger than the casino world. So the casino world is limited by location, by branding, by customer base. There are more Sports Betting players in the world than casino players. And globally, where Sports Betting is regulated, it is a wide area game, same as lottery, rather than a destination game like a casino. So you would go to a casino to play poker and roulette, but you need to be able to have access to a bigger game like Sports Betting. And Australia and U.K. and Italy, who are globally the most advanced Sports Betting countries in the world, they have adopted this wide area model. I don't see why U.S. should be different in concept. Now how strong is the casino lobby in Atlantic, in New Jersey, in Nevada and in a couple other states; in New York, very strong; in U.S., very strong.

Sometimes, you might have a situation that a geopolitical event or some economic issue that might be regional or a major move in certain commodities might pull that back.

This means going back at least the past 30 years. Passenger demand continues to grow at rates well above world GDP growth, and a strong performance is being seen across all the major areas of the world. Rarely do we see such diverse and strong results. For example, recently announced passenger growth in August was 7.2% worldwide as compared to a year ago and no single market shows less than 5% growth. Asia-Pacific, which includes India and is the largest single market, grew at 9%. North America and Europe, which combined total over 50% of the world's market, grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Furthermore, carriers are being prudent in growing their capacity, resulting in load factors reaching all-time highs. Fuel prices remain in check and the capital markets remain very accommodative. As a result, airlines around the world are earning near record profits. Even the recent failures this summer and the continuing threat of renewed geopolitical risk have failed to halt the growth and demand for air travel worldwide."

To get people that are willing to accept or willing to pay, we brought our pricing down. I don't know if I'm able to give you a specific number like 80% of revenue, 90% of revenue because it really -- the trailing revenue to us, in many cases, is not as important as the geographic location and the upside potential of the market that we're looking at.

We've seen a lot of activity recently in the lighting area. We've -- you had the phaseout of incandescent bulbs in general across the U.S. And that is driving additional adoption of LED lighting and then the integration of ZigBee into those bulbs as these home automation-type systems are rolling out, seems to be a very large trend, and so a lot of activity going on there.

How long is it going to be?
