The low end of our forecast assumes that the current demand situation, which we've seen post invasion in week 7 continues through the rest of the year, whereas at the high end assumes an improving demand situation in the coming weeks back to pre-war levels as well as a market environment that is comparable to 2021 in terms of absolute units sold in our markets, relative price level and overall demand for used cars. We therefore expect group revenues of between EUR 5.7 billion and EUR 6.8 billion with a gross profit of between EUR 470 million to EUR 580 million, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of between minus 2% and minus 3%. We expect total group units between 650,000 and 770,000 this year with 580,000 to 680,000 in merchant and 70,000 to 90,000 in Autohero."

Looking at, for example, Asia here, then normally in Q2, you have about 1.5 million barrels per day of capacity out. Now you're almost double. So the facts show that refiners will be coming back, or they're out now and obviously then will be coming back. In addition, you've got more refinery capacity coming on in '19 and '20 than seen -- we probably haven't seen in the world. So that factor, I think, is huge. When it comes to the chartering activity, we're seeing more activity now in the Middle East given the political unrest, and people will probably want their barrels out quicker. But the overhang of tonnage is not there to move the rates yet, but we're obviously watching that space closely. And I think the -- want to really watch closely is what's happening in the Atlantic. So I expect the volumes in the Atlantic, in June and July, to be a lot, lot higher than what we've seen recently.

I'd say we've intentionally wanted to change the mix of the company to a source of sales and profit, et cetera, that wasn't necessarily as reliant on government reimbursement. We wanted a greater mix of patient pay or consumer pay. And I'd rather ride with the consumer markets than ride with the volatility of, say, a Europe, where it's heavily, heavily reimbursement-driven. And given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces, you're at the whim of the next stroke of the pen to cut prices. So we wanted a different mix, and we wanted a different geographic mix. We wanted a different balance in how much we're reliant on payers, how much we're reliant on governments and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the patient themselves. So that drove some of the choice around geography and/or business areas that we believe make up a durable growth company. We also find that the predictable growth and profitability of countries that are -- or businesses that are more patient pay is, frankly, more reliable than those that, at least for us, are susceptible to reimbursement cuts, et cetera. So it doesn't mean we don't want to be in countries that are reimbursement-driven. We do. It's a matter of balance. It's a matter of mix. It's a matter of trying to have it all but not too much."

And obviously, those trends are heavily influencing us. So we see commodity price increases there with some of the key suppliers for ceramic capacitors, resistors, silicon chips and so forth. So that is creeping into the system. As I mentioned earlier on, as a reply to a previous questions, as we do the majority of the business with OEMs, we are obviously embedded into firm pricing arrangements over certain period of time, so we have no opportunity to pass on these commodity price increases to the customer base. Having said all that, we are negotiating on an ongoing basis with our suppliers in order to secure, first of all, supply -- steady supply, because in this type of booming environment, it's not always guaranteed that supply is adequate.

It includes, for the first time, government scheme, which are import in several countries. The impact of these schemes represented a positive impact of EUR 8 million in Q2 '20. It also has, for consequences, to increase the premium cession rate.

What happened after this was that because of some market movements these acquisitions were curtailed. We had only 1 operation that was relevant that increased our price level somewhat. Therefore, in the last 3 years, as you have been able to observe, there have been very few movements regarding this. No new operations have been acquired. Once again, we are at a moment with a great deal of economic uncertainty, and the country is facing great difficulties and this may exclude some opportunities. Nevertheless the company is always analyzing these opportunities.

Today, with cybersecurity, and this is really what's driving, it was cybersecurity threats for hospitals, the IT departments were under more of a microscope and more pressure to make sure that devices aren't added as networks that are going to create a security threat, and so they're involved. Most of our devices in neurodiagnostics do connect to hospital's network, and so IT gets involved to understand what those interactions are or what systems we're using and what security [ threats ] just might be in there. So we've added to the team of expertise for the sales teams to be able to answer and address those questions as well as we've added things to products in terms of security patches and security features to help us be more competitive and better meet customer needs in that area of requirements."

We estimate that Shack sales were negatively impacted by approximately $3.2 million due to nationwide protests and resulting curfews causing temporary Shack closures and reduced operating hours during the 2-week period from May 28 to June 10. Same-Shack sales declined approximately 49% in the second quarter compared to the prior year driven by a decline in traffic of 60.1% and an increase in price/mix of 11.1%. The increase in price/mix was driven by a 28% increase in our average check as a result of the significant shift into digital channels we've seen over the last few months, which have historically carried a higher average check than in Shack. In terms of sequential progression of same-Shack sales throughout the quarter, we were encouraged with the continued improvement with year-on-year declines of 64% and 42% for fiscal April and May, respectively, and 39% in fiscal June when adjusting for the impact of the protest. Including the impact of the protest, same-Shack sales reflect a decline of 42% in fiscal June. Same-Shack sales in fiscal July were down 39%, while delivering a further sequential increase in average weekly sales in the period, all of which can be seen on Page 7 of our supplemental materials."

And as we think about upstream in the segments of drilling, completion and ongoing production, it's really upstream and a lot of ongoing production. And so if we look at rig count and activity that is going on in the Permian, and some of the other deposits are placed, but really the Permian, there's good activity. And as wells go from free flow which we have participation to artificial lift and requiring parts and components or mechanical to do that, that's good for our business. And really, through the activity and change in oil price from 60s to, I believe, it's around $52 now. A lot of those producers, I mean, they worked well on their breakeven point. So our view is that continues at its rate or activity in those geographies, and if we look ahead at what's been drilled and not completed, there's a lot that can or will come online at some point. Now, hey, does global demand play into that? Does the supply play into that? But I think, supply is what, 8% above its 5-year average, doesn't seem to be having a slow down effect right now, especially in that geography given its take away to the refineries. So that's what's driving our view. Of course, there's discussions with customers and producers in that, but that's what's driving our view that the -- our second half is a lot like our first half, maybe perhaps with the potential to be a little bit better."

At the global level, as we shared last quarter, in April, we saw a decline on Managed Print Services pages, which is a good proxy, of minus 40%. We have exited July in a minus 25% range. So through the quarter, we have seen significant improvement. We have seen a constant trend. And this is really correlated to the situation versus the pandemic. In many Asian countries where the situation is much more under control, we see volumes close to where they were before the crisis. In the U.S. and in some of the Americas countries where the impact of the virus is still the strongest, they are still behind -- significantly more behind that number."

Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers.

So all around the world, voice and text for consumer and enterprise, reflecting what Vittorio has just said, to governance, the macro environment which is extremely tough and the competitive situation, which remains quite active mainly in data, so which has on top of the volume, put some pressure on the pricing. So that’s as Vittorio has said, let's say, the pressure has probably increased a little bit in December and we expect some pressure to remain in the months to come in this country. We have taken several initiatives, namely, in pricing in order to push our integrated tariffs, which has allowed us to post quite a nice growth in data as well in Italy, so -- which is good news for the future."

Natural gas prices remain low, high regional crude price differentials were cutting into Canadian oil producers' revenues, political uncertainties surrounded the crucial Keystone XL and Northern Gateway oil export pipeline projects and many producers' share prices were weak. Yet Pulse went on to deliver a record year and entered a new year in 2013 with optimism and confidence. The reasons are mainly twofold. First, Pulse's finances, already strong entering 2012, had been lifted to a new level. This year, we will continue to adjust our spending in pursuit of those initiatives that we think will generate the highest returns for our stakeholders. From here, we have the option to go further after participation survey opportunities to make data set acquisitions, to continue repurchasing Pulse shares on the open market and to pay down additional debt. We do foresee opportunities for additional participation surveys in the Duvernay and Montney plays, also, that contain multiple other prospective zones."

And that channel is becoming more confident in selling product on their own, and we're seeing that actually quarter-by-quarter. So the channel is becoming more educated, is able to produce more business with less effort from us. But it's still quite a technical sale, so we still get involved in quite a lot, if not most of the channel deals. I think the opportunity for early leverage for the channel will come out of the security kind of products that we just announced. I would say more than half of their channel have a security practice as well, and so they understand the security market extremely well. And in talking to a few channel partners when we launched the 2 security products, there was a lot of interest around how they would use that to take their existing customer base and provide a more complete security solution and a better-managed security solution. So I think we are likely to see channel leverage come more quickly in the new products we're introducing because they have a security practice today and they have a customer base that they sold security products too and they understand it much better."

In fact, on the hosted payload side, I'd say we were really the pioneer in that and have been working that for years and have enjoyed some success, but we look for more. In terms of long-term procurements and being strategic and looking how we can augment the MILSAT programs, that's one where we also have done some good early work and that have led -- has led to some RPs that are now available that we're bidding on. So I will just say, from a personal standpoint, I spend a lot of time lobbying Congress to ensure that we can look at long -- or allow longer-term procurements, just as our commercial customers enjoy. This way, we could be strategic, we can customize capacity as needed and we ultimately can offer better pricing, which is good for the American taxpayer. And actually, better for us because then we can plan long term and have the visibility that we are seeking. So I think we have done a great deal as a company. We're working, of course, as an industry, to do everything possible to change the dynamics for our military customers. So in the disaggregated systems, we are well positioned to take advantage of that. And on the Epic side, we think we have a much better performance for them to enjoy on our assets with the 10x better throughput and up to 3x to 5x better capacity we offer on the Epic satellites.

We are hoping to take it up in a significant way with this new line of switches, which we think is much more competitive. So anticipate seeing a better attach rate going forward, but as I said, it's been under -- meaningfully under 10% of the total product sales in the past. In terms of the E-Rate deferrals, so I have not -- I'm not aware of people -- of projects that we have won where people are saying, \"Hey, I'm going to wait and defer.\" I did see there was one, I think, Ruckus talked about in their Q4 earnings call where they missed $1 million.

We've had one -- obviously, there's probably handful of deals that are out where the letters have not been issued, where there's always some back-and-forth protesting and battling on some of these things.

So as countries, for instance, if we take again Chile, which has amongst the highest margins of our operations worldwide, mature or emerging markets, is because if we've got our market-leading position there, there will be other places where we continue to build a market-leading position so it would generally drift those margins up. But we are adding in new areas where we have real opportunity. So it's a portfolio approach of adding less mature opportunities into a group of countries that may be getting more mature. So net-net, you have to -- it's not clear that it would even be the right strategy to say that our average margin would go up internationally because that would signal that we're not finding new markets to actually go into and eventually build a market-leading position. So you have to look at it as a portfolio approach in International. The key in International is to make sure that when we're doing acquisitions, we have a clear discipline in terms of our return on invested capital and return on equity. And we have a clear strategic vision of how that country or that investment will eventually build into a market-leading position."

You will have to actually get the inside information in each of the region who actually are the good ones. And some of the people there in that segment are not worried about reputation versus those borrowers in the Corporate Banking segments.  So some of the principles in terms of lending practices have to be very different. And it will take time for us also to change their value system, their mindset, aligning the risk appetite across the 130 commercial banking centers across the country, while we want them to be also not moving from one end of being too broad to be very conservative as well.

So although customer flow is doing very well, and because we are the primary dealer, we have been accumulating various deals, but because of the lower volatility, offer bid spread has come down quite a lot. And that's why profits were down. But now, in October, leading up to the Presidential election, the volatility has come up a little bit. So down the road, after the election, the central bank's policies -- depending upon the central bank's policies in each country and the potential second wave of COVID-19, the volatility in the financial markets may go up after the election. So we'd like to keep our eyes on the potential changes in the markets and would like to capture the right opportunities to generate profits in the future and especially in the United States. But in the Americas, in general, we have the very strong customer base. So we'd like to really leverage the strong customer base we have."

And to your question about what it does and what makes it special, the nature of the problem changed dramatically over the last few years as deployments have moved to cloud and what has been a challenge of putting visibility into tens or hundreds of servers might be now putting visibility into thousands of virtualized servers or containers, and a large percentage of them may come and go as a normal course of operations. So traditional alerting, traditional visibility tools that assume a small number of servers to kind of stay in place aren't well suited to the needs of today's enterprise customer. But what's an even bigger point of differentiation for New Relic Infrastructure is tracking in real-time the state and configuration across all those servers. Imagine, as many of our customers do, if a serious security flaw was exposed by an open source package, New Relic Infrastructure will allow our customers to search across tens of thousands of servers and instantly see where that faulty piece of software might be installed. We also track changes in real-time. And what we found out from our customers is that the #1 risk to production availability is a change. A change that might be benign by intent but actually could cause a production problem. So we feel that this is an absolute must-have product that fits hand in glove with our other products, and we think it has great potential on the market."

And then, retailers have responded to that by cutting inventory, and so shipments really sort of came to a screeching halt over the summer months. So it was quite sudden and quite dramatic, but we wouldn't expect there to be a long-term degradation in the demand for a product like shampoo in a country of the size of China. But clearly, short term it's had quite an impact. So in a country with retailers are very disparate, very varied and very regional, it's kind of hard for our customers to read when things will bounce back, but I suspect most of them do, but it's still kind of alarming to them when that happens as suddenly as that.

I think it's important to point out, though, that even if we were to shift to a loss on disposal, it's not because of the fact that the sale-leaseback transactions would be a drag on our business. It's really, I'd say, an income state geography issue, where the deals that we do for sale-leaseback transactions almost always carry a very significant per diem revenue component as well as, in some cases, substantial drop-off fees, if containers are returned into locations where there's a weak sale market. Those contributions to income show up in leasing revenue, where just the pure gain or loss on the container value shows up on the gain. And so as we..."

As we walked into COVID, it was important for us to see -- first you saw organizations really just trying to get that initial connectivity going, but that was last quarter. In this quarter, we saw that, when you engage with the customer, they understand that the perimeter basically evaporated overnight. And there is no perimeter. And it may take 1 step, it could take 2 steps, but -- and the attacker can get privileged access to the heart of their IT infrastructure. So the priority is up there. It's also in, I would say -- the analysts in the industry are putting it really as the top thing to do. But with the new account, we obviously have to go through the regular education and prioritizations that we need to go through.

There were a lot of shifts and it may -- this is very, very typical of first quarter where you have extreme volatility week to week. Some of it was calendar-driven, Valentine's Day flips off a weekend and into a -- and flips into the middle of the week, and that was a little bit of a headwind. Calendar-wise, spring break, Easter, all that shifting out in general, is not good for us. So having a time, spring break at a time where it's more likely that people would be both able and want to spend time outside. Again, so April spring break as opposed to March spring break is unbalanced or, on average, not right for us. So those are a couple of kind of things that created such headwinds. It's almost impossible to read any underlying trend by virtue of when the spring breaks are moving back and forth between March and April. And then the last thing I'd say is, on weather, we view it as a slight positive. We had a lot of rain in California, which is typically good for us, offset by some other regional issues around the country. So kind of net-net, we look at the entire thing and say it's not -- it's probably not a material impact to us since it all fell within our quarter."

In addition, for the first quarter in quite some time, our network tools product portfolio experienced an improvement in commercial market growth of the first quarter of 2013.

So being able to integrate those banks quickly is a big benefit to us. The Florida Panhandle is a great market. We're excited about what the team down there is doing for us. We're already in the Dallas market and Texas Star -- and the Dallas MSA and then north of that. I think that market can be a big plus for us. So we're excited to get those folks in line. The announcement in the quarter was Rodney Kroll's bank in Waco, Texas, Texas First State Bank. Great franchise there in the Waco market. A college town, undefeated town right now, I guess, we can all say. We have overlap within our markets in the Temple and Killeen area that will benefit us.

In the earlier periods, however, those gains were somewhat masked by the lower military activity. In fact, it was actually real positive that the reduced military volume was effectively offset by our growth in serving the other critical industries. But now, our gains in critical sectors such as aerospace and natural resources are showing through. They're visible. That activity in those areas is supported not only by the innovative Automated Tool Control or ATC system, which is somewhat of a halo product,  and has garnered a lot of important attention. But it also reflects -- that attention also reflects a wide array of hand and torque and power tools, all designed specifically to make the work easier for customers in critical industries.

Water segment profit margin declined about 590 basis points year-over-year to 4.8%. As we saw in the first quarter of 2011, water segment revenues showed continued weakness in North America and the Middle East, where we had large projects in full swing in 2010. This was offset by revenue growth invested in Europe and Oceania. This year, there's a huge change in geographic mix, and as Simon described, the commodity pressures and discreet items in Q2 compressed our water margin in the second quarter.

And while we achieved record results and grew total adjusted EBITDA by 9%, the challenge we face is that we had targeted and expected even better numbers. Demand was a little weaker than we had originally anticipated, particularly in our International segment, where security issues and concerns impacted the summer peak. In this context, we took immediate steps to adjust our European fleet size and to respond to the competitive pressures that emerged and negatively impacted our realized pricing in Europe. As a result, as you saw in last night's release, we've reduced our full year earnings estimate to be at approximately the low end of our previous estimate of $850 million to $900 million of EBITDA. In a year that has seen significantly negative first quarter pricing, fleet cost pressures and an unstable geopolitical climate, this will be a meaningful accomplishment. To get here, we made significant progress on several key initiatives to drive higher margins. We achieved a substantial turnaround in pricing in the Americas. We have made progress in our manpower planning and shuttling initiatives, where we continue to see results in our productivity metrics. We have aggressively mitigated the effects of weaker vehicle residual values through the work of our fleet optimization and fleet management teams.

And in our recent past, we've actually seen when we've gone it would be, for example, the Herradura acquisition, it was of course an important acquisition for Brown-Forman to enter that category but it also helped us to develop a platform in Mexico and the Finlandia acquisition was similar for Eastern Europe, most notably for Poland before. So there are a lot of factors you'll consider when thinking about local acquisitions. In most cases, there was real attractiveness as well because the brands we were buying we thought had real potential outside those countries as well but there are some very attractive local businesses, particularly at that premium development around the world that I think a lot of people are starting to pay a lot more attention to."

I would also like to acknowledge the way our Civista team has risen to the challenge by assisting retail and small business customers across our footprint. We began this year expecting one of our biggest challenges would be the uncertain interest rate environment and the pressure it would place on our margin. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional challenges that the banking industry could not have anticipated. Civista is meeting these challenges from a position of excellent asset quality, strong capital levels and a diverse revenue stream. While the length and the depth of economic uncertainty across our footprint and the country is unclear, I am confident in our ability to meet these challenges from a position of strength."

Last month, we were pleased to announce a new long-term exclusive distribution agreement with Japan Medicalnext, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Corporation and a wholly-owned entity of MC Healthcare Incorporated. We are excited that the management of Japan Medicalnext has a wealth of spine experience within Japan and are applying their market expertise and their established operational infrastructure to help grow our business in the country. The impact to revenue growth is expected to be primarily a 2018 event.  The terms of the agreement include a long-term partnership of up to 7 years with more than 250 employees, including 50 orthopedic sales professionals in 7 offices located throughout the country. We believe Japan Medicalnext has significant experience in medical device distribution, including the Japanese spinal surgery market. We look forward to this partnership enhancing our potential to increase our market share in Japan's estimated $350 million spine market."

The inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and reduced global growth forecasts caused concern about economic weakness and contributed to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.

It remains the case, 3.5 years on, that not a single significant strategic or operational decision that we have made or not made has been driven externally by political influences. We've been managing the company for all its shareholders in the best way we know how. And therefore, all I know is what's happened so far, and I have no reason to believe that will change. But of course, there are risks in the future, but that's the position so far. The second thing that I'd say is we all have to recognize that the banking industry is quite politicized everywhere in the world today, as a result of its role in the financial crisis and the tensions, the political tensions arising from the financial crisis. And so banks equals politics, whether that's in Spain or Germany or here or America or Ireland, or you pick it. And in that sense, there are political risks and calculations that have to be made for the banking industry and the regulations it affected and the other pressures that can be on it. We've seen that in the U.K., away from RBS, rather recently. So I do think that bank investors are right to worry about politics, but it's not clear to me that RBS is particularly distinguished in that regard. But clearly, the best way we can insulate ourselves from this is to do our jobs well. I think if we fall down on the job, we invite more interference from whatever quarters. If we do our jobs well, we'll be left to get on with doing it."

Right now, we kind of think about population sequencing programs as ones that are sponsored by the government and are really directed to understanding the diversity of the population in some countries, understanding a reference genome that's likely underrepresented in the reference work that's been done previously, and then understanding the variation in their local population and then trying to learn enough about those variations medically to be able to influence what's happening clinically in that country. So that's kind of how we think about POP seq. In the U.S., there's lots of sales we've made of X Tens that are not that, but in other countries, there's some that are certainly borrowing sample streams from the clinical work that's going on in the country, Garvan being an example. So if you think about that, could Garvan become a POP seq project in the next 5 years? Maybe they will. Sidra is another example, where we're installing an X Ten and there's a possibility that, that morphs into a population sequencing project. So I think the lines are going to get a little bit blurry, but probably in the next year or 2, we kind of think that these POP seq projects as digitally incremental to what we're doing in the base X Ten business."

So it wasn't so much of a downside on those as it was the volatility, I think, that we were trying to highlight.

I think the legacy on-premise e-mail security equipment, the level of innovation and investment that's gone into many of those platforms by the vendors that sold them has really not extended to deal with the more modern targeted attacks. So URL-based threats, weaponized attachments that contain the latest ransomware and polymorphic attacks and impersonation attacks. So really, the effectiveness of these solutions is failing customers and that's seeking them -- that is driving them to seek change. I think the second and another very important aspect here is that as customers look more and more to use cloud-based e-mail services like Office 365, the idea of backhauling their traffic onto their networks through these on-premises appliance-type strategies is far less attractive. And so they look for more of a cloud-to-cloud-based model for deploying e-mail security alongside their cloud e-mail investments."

In terms of oil demand, the 2012 outlook has also stabilized after a series of downward revisions in recent quarters. Based on the weakness of non-OPEC supply, OPEC spare capacity being at the 3-year low and supply risks from a number of sources, we do not expect oil prices to weaken significantly in the coming quarters. In the U.S., the production growth from unconventional gas, coupled with very mild winter weather, has driven storage to record levels.

The impact of higher long-term interest rates continued to affect both new loan commitments, which were down 27% to $212 million, as well as spreads, down 5 basis points to $148 million.

Having said that, as a general trend, solar will be -- has been in developed world the largest new energy generation resource and is -- almost everyone is projecting that it will continue to be in most markets. So that will mean, in our view, intense competition for the foreseeable future in mainstream power plant. There's still ability to differentiate in power plants. Location matters, local knowledge matters in terms of the cost to perfecting the site. You can get a premium depending on your transmission position. So selectively, you can get better PPAs in, we believe, the Americas. But if you say broadly worldwide, I think our view is changing to intensely competitive certainly for the foreseeable future.

The effects of foreign exchange and lower-priced corn, which is passed through in our selling prices, were partially offset by the solid volume growth. Gross profit was down $19 million as a result of unfavorable currency, primarily in South America and modest margin compression in North America from higher net corn costs. Adjusted operating income was lower than last year by $8 million as the decline in gross profit was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses. Reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by $35 million. This reflects $33 million from a noncash charge of goodwill impairment in Southern Cone, given the political and economic volatility and continued uncertainty. In addition, we incurred $2 million from the acquisition costs related to the Penford transaction. Our earnings per share reported and adjusted EPS were $0.83 and $1.30 per share, respectively.

And when you come from very high numbers to a smaller number, it really makes it hard for them to do that, plus planning, do they have sequester, don't they have sequester? That's really tough on them. We're really trying to work with them in any way we can. But Dave and I would both tell you that, from our standpoint, planning for sequester, we know exactly in our minds what the Army will be doing and that's in our forecast as we look at things.

We have, however, in Europe, looked for the last 5 to 7 years, a large amount of biosimilar competition. And we have modeled Europe and worked successfully to defend our business in Europe over the last 5 to 7 years. So we've done a combination of modeling Europe as a totality or taking countries inside Europe that, as best as possible, would potentially emulate practices of all behaviors in the U.S. And we use those models to create long-range plans.

I know that there's a lot of discussion back in Washington, D.C. about both an extenders package in general and specifically, about the biodiesel tax credit. It's going to be an issue that's certainly going to be brought up. I hesitate to really give you a guess on whether or not it's going to be prospective or retroactive. While I've always continued to believe and what I've always said I think to everyone is that the farm community strongly supports the biodiesel tax credit. And so whether it comes in prospectively or retroactively, we believe that there's strong political momentum to eventually have it in place. But there's a lot of discussion, and there's a lot of discussion on changing it from a producers -- from a blender's to a producer's tax credit as well. Generally in Washington, D.C., once you have something, particularly a tax program, in effect in a particular manner, it's hard to change it. And so while I know that -- I strongly believe -- nobody knows what Washington, D.C. will do. But I strongly believe that we will have a tax credit either prospectively or retroactively for next year. The chances of it actually being converted to a producer's cash credit are probably less solid than the fact that it does actually get implemented as a blender's just because you're changing the format. And there's always resistance to change anytime you try to do something like that."

One of the things -- people need to make the hard decision taking older rigs out of the market that aren't going to work and even for those who have newer fleets, making the decision that if there's not work in the foreseeable future that you take the rig out of the market for a period of time and cold stack it. So what you bid has a little bit to do with what you see for the future of the rig, where you are in the geography, what the client is and what the future prospect in the area is. And I think you're talking about different levels when you talk short-term work and long-term work. Obviously, we look at it on a portfolio basis.

It's a typical program that would result in approval if the data are supportive. So exercise capacity is a valid measurement upon which to establish approval for an agent in pulmonary hypertension, the FDA's made that clear. And it's also clear that cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a valid methodology to measure exercise capacity. In fact, the readthrough from measures like PVR are more directly correlated with some of the endpoints that you see in CPET compared to, for example, 6-minute walk. So we will be testing 6-minute walk in the study, but we fundamentally believe that cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a more informative and sensitive measure, meaning that's important in an incident patient population that will be also receiving essentially best standard of care dual-background therapy and then ralinepag or placebo on top of that. And we're confident in our ability to execute this across multiple sites and multiple countries in an efficient and effective manner to get the readout we need."

The BLACKHAWK remains the vehicle of choice for the Army, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue to see strong international order growth there. In terms of U.S. Military, not much really going out. We have a multi-year contract with the government for BLACKHAWKs that will go through early 2012. We're in the process of renegotiating a multi-year 8, which will be for over 500 more BLACKHAWKs. And again, good opportunities down at Sikorsky. Also have opportunities internationally with the BLACKHAWK, you've got opportunities in India and, again, other emerging markets. Pratt on the JSF, obviously, there's cost pressure there. I think we've met the customer's goal in terms of cost reduction. We are on track for that. We are seeing, of course, pressure on the Military side of Pratt for C-17. That production is going down, but hopefully we'll see some orders in India that will keep that production line going for a while. We also got an order this past quarter for 25 spare engines for the F-22, which will keep that production line going into 2012. So again there's pressure out there on cost. But again, we got I think very, very solid reputation with the customers and on very, very good programs.

The in-house costs, they have been split between various other lines such as, again, [indiscernible] and then consumables [indiscernible] and so on and so forth. What you see is transportation expenses with that third-party provider. So basically what happened in the program that we've been undertaking was aimed at the growth of the utilization rates of our own truck fleet. And we managed to get better technical state of our fleet and to improve on the punctuality on the delivery windows and on how we do the routing for our trucks. And thanks to all these measures, we've managed to get away from a lot of third-party contractors and that brought savings as well. And the second part of the reduction of this cost is related predominately to the share and the value of the impacts of the groups. And during this year, for various reasons, we'll prefer to buy a lot of products in the domestic market rather than from other countries, so that also had certain impact on this transportation expense. Overall, from the management account, because how we internally view our transportation expense kind of on all-inclusive basis, I can confirm that they lower substantially cost reductions in cost of delivery as well.

But we really think the opportunity to grow the utilization of vector-borne disease screening is a bigger opportunity than to realize price. So interestingly, there are 70 million-plus dogs in the U.S. and not all of them go to the veterinary clinic, unfortunately. 35 million are on some kind of heartworm preventative. And only 21 million of them, roughly -- these are all rough numbers -- are tested annually for heartworm, even though it's really recommended to test before we put them on a preventative. And then less than 9 million of those have a heartworm test associated with the full vector-borne disease screen, even though 75%, 80% of the dogs in the country are exposed to ticks. So we think that there is an opportunity to continue to expand the utilization of heartworm and, in this case, vector-borne disease screening.

However, this state reimbursement rate increase is currently scheduled to be delayed 6 months, similar to the past few years, and is scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2022. We continue to have discussions with state leaders about the delayed timing of the reimbursement increase and potential to accelerate as a result of the additional Medicaid funding from the federal government. As we have discussed on our last earnings call, we continued to assess the New York CDPAP statewide change. While we have approximately $52 million of revenue in this particular service line in New York, it has not been a very profitable program and will be less so with the recently published reimbursement rates. Let me remind you that we are only a fiscal intermediary in CDPAP with a caregiver working directly for the consumer. This is not our normal form of personal care services.

The Migration Advisory Committee has made its recommendations, and they appear to have been picked up by the government and should become effectively legislation from the 1st of Jan, and that, as I mentioned in my presentation, effectively deals with the immigration challenges. There still is the issue around recognition of their dental qualification and that is something that we still need to overcome. So that remains an impediment.

But in addition, we had impairment losses of $185 million and a net tax expense of $7 million. The impairment loss is mainly in our Tertre plant in Belgium, reflecting a more conservative outlook on long-term ammonia prices due to the expected effects of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and that this particular plant currently has limited flexibility to import ammonia. Despite having a loss before tax, we recognized a net tax expense of $7 million, and this is mainly due to the Tertre impairment being realized without a tax effect. And in addition, we had losses in certain countries that are not recognized as deferred tax assets.

These production levels was caused by: Rubiales and Yarigu fields successful drilling campaigns and the secondary enhanced recovery program in Chichimene and Castilla; the reversal of Pauto and Florena fields on February 29, which were operated by Equion; and 1,400 barrels from the JV with Oxy in the Permian Basin. During the period, production was affected mainly due to public order, security incidents and the decrease in gas sales, mainly related to operational aspects in the Cartagena refinery and the decrease in national demand from March 17 onwards related to the health emergency that caused a massive reduction in terms of mobility and the reduction in the refinery's consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

And I mean, this improvement will not be in any case enough to compensate the total variation coming -- the total negative variation coming from Egypt. In other words, the core Europe will improve, driven by the Italy price. Better results in North America. Continuous quality trend in Morocco and India and Thailand, apart from Egypt.

For the fourth quarter, our results reflect another period with a slight reduction in revenue that was due in large part to the sluggish domestic economy. Despite these economic conditions, we maintained our relentless focus on revenue quality and cost controls and are pleased with our consistent financial performance. While our diluted earnings per share decreased as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, the decrease in our pretax income was primarily due to a $30.7 million increase in fringe benefit cost that was partially driven by changes to our phantom stock plans. Adam will address the phantom stock plan expense in more detail, but the amendments to these plans in December '19 should prevent fluctuations in our share price from materially impacting our earnings in future periods. The overall operating environment in the fourth quarter felt similar to what we experienced for most of 2019. We won't, again, continue with the decrease in LTL terms, although we were pleased to see our volumes perform in line with normal seasonality when compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was the first time this year that we were in line with our normal seasonal trend.

During a year characterized by global macro economic uncertainty, domestic political uncertainty and an ever-approaching fiscal cliff, we are proud of our successes in the core brokerage business. Our brokerage account growth outpaced our growth over the past 3 years, with more than 120,000 net new accounts. And we kept more of those accounts on board with account retention at an all-time high. A similar story in brokerage assets. Net new assets into the firm were at their highest annual level since we began tracking the metric in 2007. Not bad, and all during a year when the retail investor largely remained on the sidelines, as evidenced by lower trading activity than we have seen in 6 years.

And so we're expecting those things. But also, as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, the underlying demographic trends driving overall volumes in radiology are very positive and we continue to believe that those are going to happen, if anything, be mitigated somewhat by what's going on in Washington. So we'll see what happens. I guess I'll leave you with just one thought and it's something that we talked with our customers about and frankly we've talked with some people in your line of work about. Fundamentally, healthcare reform is going to be a catalyst for change in the radiology industry. It's going to be a catalyst for looking for more effective and efficient ways of delivering care across the country. And we like to think that teleradiology is perfectly positioned to exploit that opportunity and to help our physician radiology groups and their patients in that regard.

And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses a sovereign and currency risk in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate that the return can recover the known risks within those contracts. And obviously, if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation, that has a natural balance on devaluations. Because usually, after a devaluation, inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return inflation coverage to mitigate against that."

The SolarStorm attack highlighted that enterprises need a comprehensive, up-to-date map of their full IT infrastructure environment, including understanding their own networks as well as external attack surfaces and supply chains.  In order for security teams to have an edge over the adversaries, they need to embrace next-generation technologies that leverage AI, machine learning and automation. To help our customers, we set up a rapid response program. And when I say rapid, it was rapid. Our acquisitions of Expanse and Crypsis almost felt prescient. The team swung into action. We updated XDR for all the new threat vectors. We offered free assessments from our Crypsis team. We also evaluated the attack surfaces from the outside in for Expanse and discovered that there were dozens of affected customers, including major government agencies and large companies, many of which were actively communicating with SolarStorm malware command and control infrastructure. So far, we've received over 1,000 assessment requests and have completed over 500. We believe that the SolarStorm attack raises the mid- and long-term criticality of the cybersecurity industry as a whole. This will result in more awareness and focus on cybersecurity, which in all candor, is the need of the hour given the complete reliance on technology in these times. We expect that this attack will be a wake-up call to all enterprises to modernize cybersecurity and will serve as a net incremental tailwind, not just for us but also for the industry."

While we have experienced a nice recovery in some countries and products from the effect of the global pandemic, we unfortunately have not seen this everywhere in our business. Some markets and products are still feeling the lingering effects that the pandemic has had on the purchasing pattern of our large global customers and overall utilization by patients. Based on the results of the first 6 months for 2021, we believe at this time, it is prudent to adjust our guidance range for full year revenue from the original range of $16.4 billion to $16.8 billion to the new range of $16 billion to $16.4 billion. This lowers the midpoint of our range by $400 million."

As to whether we think that we are going to continue seeing problems as we move forward, probably so. It's been a while now that companies we've had payment delays, a couple of days, throughout most of the portfolio. Then to check our records we have very little or nothing in terms of past-due loans for a long time. By the way, like Jaime just said, even the loans that we're currently restructuring, are actually current as to our interest and principal because the maturities haven't taken place. It's just that we have concluded that when principal maturities do occur, we're probably going to have to give those people more time to pay us back. Again, the magnitude of the problem is that we see coming down the pipeline is anywhere from $25 million to $35 million on which the $12 million in additional specific reserves that we established should be more than enough. That's a fairly conservative provision level on problems, on loans that become past-due. It's consistent with our experience. We just manage them through once we -- and see what happens if the economic environment doesn't get worse, we will work those out, just in case again, we establish reserves. We need to be technical about it."

The strategic benefits of this acquisition are numerous. One reason TFI was so attractive is that it supports both our environmental and our waste oil collection business growth plan. On the environmental side, there's a significant opportunity to cross-sell our services into 20,000 customers that are essentially under-penetrated with the many services our environmental team has to offer. In addition, Thermo Fluids geographically complements Safety-Kleen's branch network. Thermo Fluids has a presence in 21 states, primarily in Western U.S., and its network includes 36 permanent facilities, many of these large terminals and a number of which have rail access. Thermo Fluids also has a well-maintained transportation fluid, including many trucks and railcars. And on the waste collection side, adding Thermo Fluids to our existing used motor oil business will make available new supply to our re-refineries from the most cost-effective locations across the country. In addition to those first 2 initiatives, we also recently expanded our existing share buyback program, raising the total capacity to $300 million."

The income tax provisions for both the 2010 and 2009 third quarters were affected by changes in accruals for uncertain tax provisions principally related to the expiration of certain tax statutes of limitations. These changes amounted to a net gain of $1.2 million in Q3 2010 and a net gain of $3 million in the same period in 2009. Last year's tax provision was also affected by the company's payment in settlement of the lawsuit during the quarter ended September of 2009, which resulted in a tax benefit of $800,000, offset in part by losses in Asia principally related to the impairment of goodwill that had minimal tax benefit.

So ultimately, it is a reflection of the total amount of issuance and shares outstanding. But there are corporate actions and other things that tend to be a bit seasonal that can move that. So a little bit of the bump that you saw in the second quarter is reflective of that. It's somewhat offset by the very slow limited amount of activity that we're seeing in corporate trust, which again, is reflective of the amount of trusteeships that we have.

And it's often once you get a recovery but you see the lapses. So part of it is just customer behavior, a classical thing. As always, they were the last.

Under the program, we typically operate our cargo scanning equipment for the customer, manage, design and build inspection sites, either ourselves or with a local partner, and analyze the resulting images and store the images matched with identifying data such as cargo manifests, custom declaration and/or vehicle license numbers. We have also provided high-bandwidth, high-reliability data networks that manage the high volumes of data generated by our services using our proprietary CertScan software and interface with the customer's network. By paying for a service rather than buying the technology, the customers gained financial flexibility as well as guaranteed uptimes and, most importantly, technology refresh. These programs normally are multiyear programs with quite a lot of investment upfront by us and a long-term commitment by our customer. The programs have proven to be a very effective law enforcement tool against the smuggling of drugs, weapons, currency and other frequently smuggled items such as cars, liquor and cigarettes. Not only do the programs improve safety and security for the public, they increase transparency at customs checkpoints, thereby benefiting the shippers while increasing the accuracy of customs, thereby benefiting the government in the collection of lawfully required duties."

So generics are very different from brandeds, where you have -- maybe have a country price and then you have issues of cross-country and quota pricing, generics are much more, like other items where multiple suppliers can do it, and regulations in most countries allow you as long as you meet certain specs or regulations or FDA, whatever to take from anywhere to anywhere.

In terms of the primary insurer rate environment, we continue to see some variation between rates depending upon geography and risk, but the broad trend remains favorable. In the U.S., we continue to see ongoing signs of improving rates for many of our customers. Across the reinsurance sector, disciplined underwriting is prevalent, though not without competition, particularly obviously given the challenging investment environment, we expect that discipline remain. We do believe that the favorable primary insurer pricing environment will also benefit reinsurer experience since reinsurance rates are typically indexed to primary insurance premiums. Internationally, we're seeing auto insurance pricing vary between 8% increases in Germany, the biggest market for our IIS business, but relatively flat in the U.K. But on balance, the trend is positive across the entire portfolio."

During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $1.79 and net income of $263 million, both of which were driven by a strong underlying performance of the business. I'd like to remind everyone what the underlying business is. AerCap is the world's largest owner of commercial aircraft. This provides us with tremendous scale and insight to the entire aviation industry. We place our aircraft in long-term leases to 200 customers in 80 countries. This diversification, coupled with our proactive approach to risk management, has contained credit cost to 1% of revenue throughout the last decade. The relentless focus of the AerCap platform on a consistent strategy and operating excellence has resulted in double-digit earnings growth and 12 years of uninterrupted GAAP profitability. This has been achieved despite a $147 oil, the financial crisis, the Eurozone crisis, et cetera. Furthermore, this unrivaled value-creation has been achieved without any large financial or industrial parent. This is the AerCap business."

As well, relating to the LIT acquisition, we believe that we have a leadership position in embedded security for high-performance processing for defense and intelligence applications. And with the wave of flow downs from DoD relating to program protection security requirements, we're exceptionally well positioned there and that becomes the driver of growth in not only domestic sales, but also for foreign military sales, where our customers are looking to export their capabilities overseas. That technology needs to be protected. And so we're kind of right in the middle of the -- of that particular trend. So overall, we feel that we're well positioned.

And here, we also had kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business that tends to be kind of lumpy because you're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers, and they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong, and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform. The integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

So I think it has been consecutively 7 or 8 quarters that we have done extremely well in the European geography, much ahead of our growth in the U.S. geography. So just to basically be on the cautious side, any headwinds that you see from this growth that we are reporting in the European geography that might -- you might want to be cautious about? Otherwise, you might want to see -- you will see this continuing growth in the next few quarters as well? And secondly, on the overall growth front, I mean, right now, if you look at our size, around 5 -- more than $5 billion quarterly and $20 billion, we are bigger than Accenture in terms of our outsourcing business at this point of time. Do you, at some point of time, I mean, keeping the other macro headwinds and other things aside, do you, at some point of time, feel that size is probably becoming an impediment for us in terms of growing in, let's say, double digit. This year, of course, we managed to do it, and that's a real commendable task. But going forward, do you see the size becoming an impediment in terms of we being able to achieve an accelerating growth or a double-digit growth per se?"

Many countries outside the U.S. are experiencing slow growth impacted by weak currencies, high unemployment rates and geopolitical tensions. These factors continue to weigh on consumer spending and, in turn, the end markets in which we participate. For the past couple of quarters, we pointed towards sluggish TV demand as a key factor behind weak LED industry conditions. Potential TV growth drivers, including the Chinese New Year and Summer Olympics, have failed to spur TV demand. Research firm IHS now forecast a decline in Q1 2016 TV shipments, marking the first time since 2008 that first quarter shipments have declined year-over-year. Despite ongoing demand for general lighting, it will take the industry a bit longer to consume the excess LED supply created by weak display demand. For LED chip manufacturers, overcapacity conditions combined with intense price pressures continue to weigh on their profitability. Customers have started consolidating facilities and/or transitioning manufacturing to more profitable markets in order to improve their bottom line performance. We believe these actions bode well for MOCVD demand over the long term, however, we expect investments will likely remain soft throughout 2016."

And we see that back to kind of this historic norm of middle single digit consumer takeaway and do think that that's resilient. And unless there's some return to the 2008, 2009 economic challenges, that, that should be just good, steady growth accentuated by some new products and/or small acquisitions. On the Industrial side, about 70% of our revenues are maintenance, repair and remodeling. So both of those facts really answer part of your question in relationship to our company's resilience. As Rusty highlighted, the vast majority of our business in Europe, which is a little more than 20% of our total revenues, is in Northern Europe, and the largest portion of it is in Germany. I think our second largest geographic exposure or country exposure would be the U.K. We are concerned about what we're seeing there in terms of slowdown in a number of our European businesses. And obviously, to the extent that the euro continues to deteriorate, that will negatively impact all of our results as they're translated back in U.S. dollars whether or not the underlying core business has some positive sales and earnings growth or in some cases, which we're already seeing, some deterioration in their performance.

So core civil infrastructure, transportation and water, which are the markets that we are most bullish about.

And so when you couple our market dominant position on the engineering design side with Shimmick that has an incredible position, where we now have both the design and the construction capabilities that is consistent with where the market is going. If you look back since 2010, over the last 7 years, we've seen a 50% increase in the number of integrated delivery or design build procurements for transportation projects here in the United States. And so that increasing integrated delivery requires us to have both the design and the construction capability. We're seeing that accelerating dramatically. The P3 market is accelerating dramatically. We're seeing it at LaGuardia, JFK, Penn Station. We're seeing 2 projects for $3 billion being led out by LAX here under the P3 model.

And we are around close to now INR 10,000 crores with new CV, used, refinanced, the tractors, the 2-wheelers. So we are doing everything from 2 wheel to 22 wheel actually, right, which is used, new and refinanced. So and we are not actually a product-skewed kind of organization, no. We actually want to de-risk ourselves from across geographies, across products, across use. So I think growing by 30% every year on this kind of platform won't be so challenging. And we are targeting that by March '22, we should be around more than INR 20,000 crores of assets around this. So -- which can be a mix of any of which is good to use on the road. So that's our strategy. And so our -- we are not worried about how the market will grow.

And quite frankly, if you look at geographically where we are versus what the potential is in key markets, we're only 1/3 of the way, let's say, where we want to be in terms of being able to fully coverage large pieces of geography that we want to get great penetrations. Then it comes down to execution. The sales execution training of our sales forces, training of physicians and clinicians, and then thirdly or fourthly, it would be adding new products and further generations of technology, that you can show the additional benefits to patients once you bring clinicians up the technology curve.

This year, your competitors have started to move the customers aggressively on the bundle tariffs, which impacts your price per megabit [indiscernible], and you have to reduce the prices. And how this all would protect the market? And second question is on Ukraine. So results are quite good in the first quarter, a little bit surprising for me.

The vast majority of the flu cost hit us in the month of December in Medicaid and was more prevalent with the CHIP, and the aged, blind and disabled populations. Our experience matched up with the external markers from a geography standpoint with more severe incidents in Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri.

While we are hopeful recent appreciation of the Brazilian real will continue, we remain cautious due to the volatile macro and political environment. We also expect our adjusted tax rate to be 25% to 26%. This is slightly lower than our original guidance, driven by lower expected pretax income. Original guidance on commodities, CapEx and new restaurants remain unchanged."

Fourth -- first quarter -- fourth quarter, remember, was impacted by the displacement that was alluded to earlier. So I think the more key number was December when it was a pure quarter without the impact of political, and that ended up a plus 15%, in that neighborhood. And in the first quarter, it's pacing nicely as well. We've got some ups and downs because of the Super Bowl being a January event this year and a February event last year. But again, when you look at March, it's, I think, right around 20% right now. So it remains strong. But it's actually nice to see that our strength is a little bit broader than just auto, like it was early last year."

As we've previously announced, second quarter business trends were more challenging than we expected, especially for our European brand companies. At the time of our March guidance, we clearly underestimated the impact that the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa would have on our business for the remainder of the year. While we got the estimates right for the second quarter, which was close in, we significantly missed our estimates for the impact of the MENA events for the second half of the year. And to a lesser extent, our revenues were also affected by the unfortunate events in Japan, which had just occurred at the time of our March earnings call and it was too early to know how and to what extent these events would affect our business in that part of the world."

It's undoubtable that Internet is where the company has to go on a market share broadband basis, the consumer demand to utilize higher speeds with new technologies coming in with 12, 14 devices attached to the home through Wi-Fi. As we look out, it may just so clear and most importantly, the compelling metrics from Québec City, from the Aliant footprint where the churn is lower, the ARPU's better, it's clearly where to go. And now there have been modem restrictions on speed capabilities, et cetera. In fact, even when we launched the 1 gigabit service on Monday, it will say 940, because we have to wait for the next modem that takes it over 100, so over the 1. So it's the exact same technology that Google's launched in the United States. And so we definitely, just excited about what it's going to do for us in the future from a competitive perspective, and that's why we're making the investment. There's no doubt, the one thing I would say, depending on the geography in the country and subscriptions to OTT services, some markets are much heavier users of OTT services than other. And so they may have higher demands for speed than some of the other geographies. And so we'll have to see that as we go out. But clearly, the reason we're -- everywhere we have fiber, we're just going to launch this product."

And that's the driver of adoption for our marketplace. So we replace a lot of these traditional tools, which requires an engineer to go -- a security expert to use the tool, to identify probabilities as we bring significantly more valuation.

Our analysis also led us to believe that financial gain was not the likely motive and that the information was not as useful in targeting individual consumer accounts. However, on a case-by-case basis, we offered additional remediation such as risk-based authentication to customers protecting web-based consumer financial transactions. The suspicions that our attack was targeting the defense sector was reinforced in June when Lockheed Martin disclosed an unsuccessful attack on its systems had utilized, among other elements, information taken in the attack on RSA. Lockheed Martin had implemented many security measures, including our best practices and successfully detected and thwarted this attack. Subsequently, they accelerated their plans for total replacements to complete their SecurID remediation. I would note the Lockheed Martin incident was not the result of a new attack on RSA, and there was no change in customer risk or recommended remediation steps. What did change was our customer's sensitivity to risk. This was caused by the same news flow around cyber attacks as in addition to press coverage of the attack on Lockheed Martin, there was broad media coverage of attacks on organizations including Google, Sony, Epsilon, the Australian government and PBS. While these attacks were entirely unrelated to RSA, the publicity resulted in many customers risk tolerance going down while the level of awareness and concern went up."

The exact timing of that change will depend on the timing of 2 shipments to the U.S. Navy for the customized Threat Emulation System that we announced in June. Regardless of when it occurs, that first shipment is a major milestone for Giga-tronics. Up until now, all ASG systems we've shipped have been hardware only. Our customers buy our ASG hardware and integrate it into test systems that they design. The systems that are being prepared to ship to the Navy are the first that are integrated with the Threat Emulation software that stems from our partnership with Lockheed Martin that we announced in December of 2015."

We have REMICADE patent protected in the major EU countries, where the vast majority of sales aren't till late 2014. We filed for pediatric market exclusivity in the EU based upon the new pediatric indications, and we're hoping that they may bring exclusivity to 2015. But when you think about biosimilars, we expect the impact in the first few years in any of these countries to be relatively slow for the following reasons: these will be the first monoclonal antibody biosimilars approved in EU. In general, we don't believe that they're going to take patients off of their current therapy. We think that the product will be limited to new patients, they won't switch if patients are controlled. And then you're going to need to have mechanisms for approval for reimbursement, for physician familiarity, because it's not going to be necessarily therapeutically substitutable. So it's going to take a lot of support and promotion to be successful in the marketplace. So we continue to watch it and monitor it well. But at this point, we feel confident that we'll continue to be successful with REMICADE and SIMPONI."

The Security Paper Product segment continues to be adversely impacted by a strong Swiss franc relative to the euro and overcapacity in the industry resulting in sales competition for tenders. Despite these difficulties, Landqart has a strong order book with good visibility well into the second half of the year. The mill is currently operating at full capacity. Estimated volumes to be produced and sold in 2015 are expected to be significantly higher than in 2012. Landqart is now producing its second order of its new composite paper-polymer-paper substrate Durasafe and is pursuing several more sales opportunities for this new product. The second orders of Durasafe includes security threats from Fortress optical film division. Landqart has also been awarded paper orders in several new markets during the first quarter of 2013. These orders are expected to be produced and delivered later this year. The Landqart mill has substantially completed the majority of the production of its largest banknote order and has delivered over 70% of its contract volume. The Landqart mill is continuing its efforts to enter into new markets to diversify its customer base in preparation for the competition of this contract. The company is confident that it will continue to meet its sales targets through a combination of repeat orders in established markets together with new business. Landqart has improved operational results systematically over the past 2 quarters and management anticipates this trend to continue through the second quarter of 2013."

There is now, in São Paulo and some of the large cities, a very tough law with respect to drinking and driving that has made an important dent on the consumption of beverages, especially for beers. And obviously, for us, on-premise volumes have also decreased because fewer people are attending bars and that kind of beverage consumption at night because -- it is called the zero tolerance alcohol consumption, and it's really -- what I understand is that even with drinking 1 beer, if you're driving, you're in trouble, as opposed to other countries where there's a probably a more flexible, if I may use that word, level of alcohol in the blood levels. That has put a lot of pressure on the beer companies. Our beer volumes are -- Heineken volumes that we saw were also affected by that. And that has created a little bit more pressure on the CSD front, because the competitors are also looking to recuperate part operate of that, I guess, volume being lost in beer.

Operating expenses rose 140 basis points to 60.4% of sales. The largest driver of the increase was higher general and administrative cost of 150 basis points, primarily reflecting strategic investment and capabilities, such as R&D and information technology as well as our acquisition activities. Retail store expenses rose 40 basis points, reflecting the addition of almost 150 freestanding retail stores over the past year. Partially offsetting these increases was 60 basis points of favorability and advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses, due primarily to the mix impact from the strong growth of our lower advertisement brands as well as the cadence of major launch activities for our heritage brands."

But while the pound has fallen compared to our expectations early in the year, we have seen improvements in the Russian ruble and Canadian dollar that have offset, keeping full year currency headwind of approximately in the same range. The full year GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.05 with an effective tax rate of approximately 21%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will be at least $2.97, which includes a tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments.

Our strategy is to grow into that space, and Dan is working on helping us with specific opportunity, near term, intermediate term, to penetrate more into that space. We already have a quite nice presence there, and feel like we have a good chance of increasing there. The other big thing that can happen nationally, is a national strategy for Cyber which hasn't really emerged. There's been a lot of discussion and even at the Congressional level, a lot of proposed legislation. There's some prospect that the Department of Homeland Security may have a bigger role, let's say, outside of the classified environment for architecture standards sort of buttoning up or protecting, defending more the total national critical infrastructure for Cyber. And that could spawn new requirements that would be more pure Cyber content.

So on a year-on-year basis, I think that you are anticipating some profit growth, so can you share with us the basis, on which basis are you seeing that you would be able to grow your profit? And quarter-by-quarter, by which quarter do you think that you will be able to turn around your profit trend? My second question has to do with the regulation. I think that there have been pressures coming from KCC and there are 2 major elections planned for the rest of the year, which means there will be a higher pressure coming from the political sector, regarding the tariff cuts going forward. And if you look at the basic fees for LTE smartphones, it does seem rather high and currently, you are providing discounts on top of such basic fees. So from the perspectives of the subscribers and the government and the regulators, these basic fees might appear a little too high, calling for further pressure to cut down on the tariff.

But given some of the challenges in the Indian economy that are relatively recent, and we've seen enrollments in a number of courses in India tailed back in this year and we've seen some universities actually shut down individual courses. We're in a bit of a bubble in India in higher education as more and more students saw opportunities there, there's been a correction of that. But we don't see that as being a long-term issue."

Maybe a little counterintuitive that SafeNet, as a security company, was the first one to acknowledge it. But it really isn't. It's the security companies that don't pretend the threat can't get past the perimeter. The security companies know they can. The security companies have been dealing with it. SafeNet, as you know, I have a history with SafeNet.

So the KYC-related activities had a cost increase, quarterly cost increase by EUR 75 million. There's another effect here that you see. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018, you may remember that we had a reduced accrual for performance-related pay last year on the back of the settlement. And that's an important factor, as a consequence of which, now you see an increased cost if it comes to performance-related pay for this year. Now quarter-on-quarter, expenses, excluding regulatory costs, were EUR 38 million higher. This was mainly driven by the KYC-related costs, some investments in business growth. The CLA impact that we have seen in many different countries in which the salaries are basically increasing have been generally absorbed by cost discipline.

But honestly, that said, that pipeline is, I think, going to go ahead. I think that terminal will get built. And there'll be a couple of Bs of gas that needs to be produced out for Northeastern B.C. that will require upwards of 20 new build rigs. But it is going to be -- we're talking about mid-decade."

That has been a very successful. It's thanks to the IDENTIKEY that we can now also tackle large, very large enterprises, with that offering. So we see in detail an increase. On the other hand, we saw also an increase in all those applications, gaming being one of it. Gaming is certainly not hurted by the economical crisis. But there are also other social security distributors that are securing their transactions with their customers. So in these both areas, we see really a increase in demand and also in execution."

It's driven by the obvious concerns with the changes in the weather patterns and how we impact that -- I mean integrate that. So Greg, if can you talk about geography? It moved a little."

These are a manageable excise tax environment, stable industry volume trends, our superior brand portfolio, our market share growth, a favorable pricing environment, limited input cost increases and strong productivity gains. The threat of disruptive excise taxes has always been a concern. However, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases usually do not generate the targeted increase in government revenues nor are they sustainable. Consequently, there have been no excise tax increases implemented or announced so far this year that we would deem to be extreme in any of our key markets, despite large government budget deficits in numerous countries. On the contrary, we are witnessing a more reasonable approach both in terms of incidents and the structure of excise taxes, most notably in the European Union, as governments are keen to secure sustainable revenue streams from tobacco taxation. Several countries in Europe are most likely to increase general VAT rates this year. But overall, we believe that such increases should be manageable."

But we are encouraged with our results. And we've said many times before, I think what we're seeing is kind of the strength of the diversity of our portfolio at this point. We've got broad-based, positive sales growth in Construction, it's not unique in one geography. Backlog grew in the quarter, and it's across many other, I'll call it, range of profitable niches that we play in across our business. One other point of color that may help, we saw a good, balanced contribution from both the U.S. and Canada. Canada grew a little better than the 15%. It grew at 17% for Construction. The U.S. grew at 14%. So on a combined basis, it was 15%. And I'll tell you, it's interesting as well, the sales to contractors in the Construction segment was up for both datacomm and electrical contractors this quarter.

As we have said previously, order rates can be lumpy, particularly in the installation business, and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.

I -- we highlighted it as unusually low because we think that a significant part of that shortfall from traditional margins was specific to that quarter. However, I'll temper that by saying that to the extent that we're running our factories at relatively low levels of utilization and with the reduction of orders, the global competition is intense, that it may take a few quarters to get back to traditional D&S margins. That view is reflected in our guidance."

While the caution still factors in to our decision making today, some important developments have taken place. The fourth quarter and much of 2012 have been characterized by the restructuring and refinancing of our business. Through this process and the performance of our businesses, we have also created a framework for disciplined growth. We successfully completed our debt financing strategy in a way that generated maximum value for our shareholders. The corporation had its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in revenue and complemented that performance with strong operating cash flow. Progress continued on increasing operating margins at each of the groups and finally, we have maintained healthy backlogs across the country --  the company. So while market demand conditions will go through their cycles, our teams stay focused on serving their customers, on operational excellence through 80/20, generating and preserving cash and ultimately creating value for shareholders.

We had hoped to deal with Anglo Irish directly and avoid having the portfolio go through a broad public marketing process, it didn't work out that way. The portfolio was market publicly and not surprisingly, found lots of interest. Portfolio sold to a foreign back fund at a price we're unwilling to pay. Accordingly, we have little interest in maintaining our 3 small buildings on Newbury Street and sold them to the same buyer as a larger portfolio.

Overall, project progress is about, I think, 92% and we will introduce natural gas in the refinery -- sorry, the natural gas in the refinery was introduced on September 11. Project is on track to start first unit beginning 2013 and achieve full completion no later than end of 2013. So basically, that is the answer I can give you. Some more detail, maybe the refinery will be one of the most complex in the world. It is designed entirely optimized and dedicated to process Arabian heavy. It will be obviously, first quartile and Jubail will be also able to sell this product all over the world, thus benefiting from the best price condition available for refined product either locally, in Asia or elsewhere. Your second question was about Yemen LNG. We -- it happens that we heard that last night, another attack on the pipeline was made. Basically, it takes about 10 days to repair a pipeline blowup. I'm not saying this is no more business because I don't like it, but I have to say that we know today how to cope with such type of events. All the security issue more globally, the Yemeni military has increased their presence in the area. We have significantly reinforced surveillance along the pipeline. We've presence at valve stations. We are also considering an increase of the passive protection of the pipeline and detection system. On top of that, I would say that new sustainable development programs to fight poverty and to provide jobs along the pipeline will be also important for us and for them."

The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of retail price increases and country mix, partially offset by unfavorable cost changes related to self manufacturing and strategic sourcing and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Fourth quarter 2018 reported and adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales were 40.9% and 40.6%, respectively. Excluding China member payments, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 30%, approximately 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter 2017, primarily driven by the timing of event spending where a large distributor event which was held in Q3 of 2017 was held in the fourth quarter of 2018."

They just changed their President. So it's a little bit more difficult to advance projects, so hence, our ability to finalize some discussion with potential partners that we have. So Peru is a place where we would like to be active as well. Panama could be also another place that we feel secure enough. Columbia is a little bit more complicated and I'm not so sure that we're so interested. Brazil is huge, but we don't seem to have a handle there. It's just baked in many, many players, so we don't see where we can add value. Argentina, eventually, is a place where there's a lot of possibility. But for now, their financial position as a country is very challenging. So that's why we have looked into Chile and Peru as our first preferred market. Panama, like I said, could be something, but Panama is a very small market. You remember that we've looked in Mexico.

And of course we are not as large there directly, and we did not have a joint business with JAL at that point in time. So there are some unique regional challenges that have impacted us given our geography. And even over the Pacific, one of the areas that, on a year-over-year basis, did not increase as much as some of the other ones if for example, Japan because it was stronger the year before. So there are some unique sub-geographies within a geography. And then in the case of Latin America, for example, there are regions -- like in Brazil, we've seen pretty good economic growth but there were some other regions, and specifically I can comment on Mexico. So going back a little bit in history, in 2009, there was a unique impact from the H1N1. And that made the Caribbean pretty strong that year. So if you look at the Caribbean in 2010, it did not show some of the same strength and that's a large region for us. So there are kind of unique geographical impact that I would say.

At this time, we expect exports to be about the same as last year, but the coronavirus has had a negative impact on worldwide trade and remains an evolving unknown. With China being the first country to emerge from coronavirus impacts, we are optimistic that China may step in as a significant buyer of U.S. ethanol as part of the Phase 1 trade deal between United States and China. The support of low carbon fuel policies and market development, which reward fuels or technologies based on their life cycle carbon emission reductions remains a core strategy of Pacific Ethanol. We are working with other jurisdictions to expand low carbon markets across the country, which will provide value to the low carbon ethanol we produce."

But I would say that from our industry standpoint, we lost another 26% in the volume of trucks and buses built in that part of Europe, which brings it down to kind of 66,000 for the full year. And remember the time not long ago, it was 150. What we are forecasting, if we can ever forecast what's going to happen in the coming months, is that this will continue potentially to erode at the very beginning of the year, but starts in the later part of the year maybe to stabilize. And altogether, we believe that Russia should be flattish for this year. The good thing though is that we have, as you know, taken a very strong position in Russia, with particularly both with KAMAZ, and it's their largest heavy-duty truck provider; and GAZ, which is the largest truck provider altogether, including medium-sized trucks. And first, we get some good outperformance out of this, but more important, when the market will decide to come back up, as we resolve these political issues, we will be really strongly benefiting from that part of our business.

So what did we learn? First, our portfolio is resilient. Under the sustainable development scenario, a sub-2-degree world, all of our current projects remain strongly NPV positive. This reflects a climate resilient portfolio that can continue to meet global energy demand. Second, our oil assets, which are generally short dated, see very limited impact to their NPVs. Our Gulf of Mexico and Ghana assets see almost no value erosion. Both assets are relatively short-dated, the Gulf of Mexico having fast paybacks and Ghana having license expiry in the mid-2030s. Third, country risk and fiscal take under different climate scenarios may have some impact. Our actual Guinea asset could face greater potential value erosion than Ghana despite a similar production life, given the greater dependency of Equatorial Guinea on oil revenues. Fourth, our Mauritania and Senegal LNG assets provide cleaner sources of energy into the long term. The NPV of our Mauritania and Senegal asset is impacted to some degree under the sustainable development scenario as a result of the asset's longevity. However, the impact is not significant, largely because natural gas is recognized in these scenarios to be a key energy source for meeting global energy demand over the medium term. Fifth, long-dated oil exploration faces significant value erosion and experiences the greatest value impact under the scenarios."

This customer adopted Datadog to support their e-commerce site ahead of the new iPhone launch. Our platform enabled them to have a successful launch without any major performance issues, while other carriers in the country experienced website outages because of traffic surges. This initial 6-figure land includes all 3 pillars: infrastructure, APM and logs as well as Synthetics. Second, an established Fortune 500 retailer had a 6-figure upsell. This customer adopted infrastructure monitoring in 2017, followed by both APM and Log in 2018 and more recently, Synthetics. Over 100 of their internal teams are using Datadog as they adopt Microsoft Azure and container technologies. This customer's spend with us has grown more than 5x since our initial deal, and we believe there is still a lot more room for growth. Next, one of our largest Q3 deals was a 7-figure, 3 pillars, new logo from a higher education software and services company. This mid-market customer with fewer than 5,000 employees demonstrates the spending power of even midsized companies as they come to Datadog as a strategic partner to support their digital businesses. Finally, a large Europe-based shipping and logistics company with origins dating back over 100 years, had a 6-figure upsell in the quarter. This company was previously using built-in cloud provider monitoring tools, which lack the ability to correlate front- and back-end issue. And this is a powerful example of how Datadog enables companies in all regions and industries who are in the middle of their digital transformation."

The intention of the agency is to have a methodology. And once the methodology is defined, if you look ahead, we will be able to calculate in a more easier manner without any change in the criteria regarding whether it has an environmental risk or no, or what is the window to be defined in order to look at the country risk and these things.

Under the direction of Matt Pauls, our Chief Commercial Officer, we have undertaken considerable work sizing markets and have advanced our examination of pricing and launch strategy in the U.S., Canada and across Europe. We believe ARIKACE will require a limited commercial infrastructure because of the small focused nature of the potential physician-prescribing population for NTM patients. We believe there will be substantial overlap among the lung specialist physicians who treat CF patients with Pseudomonas lung infections and those who treat NTM lung disease, which will allow us to leverage our commercial infrastructure across both indications. In certain countries such as Japan, we are likely to seek to out-license ARIKACE."

So there is no trends that we're seeing that we've ventured into different classes of business or different geography that, that would be causing any issue there. There is a couple of issues that play. And these are really almost industry-wide. From our perspective, because we're account writers, when we look at an overall commercial account, we will write the commercial auto. And at some -- sometimes, it's a little bit at a loss in terms of rate adequacy. And so we're working hard to make sure that, from a rate perspective, we're taking some rate increases in commercial auto. The other aspect of it too, which you're starting to see again across industry is, as the economy picks up, you're having frequency, you're having additional drivers on the road. In some areas of the business sector, you're having qualifications of those drivers. Is it -- are they running the appropriate background checks on those drivers? From our perspective, our underwriting is still, I think, extremely well done, and I think it's partially rate adequacy and frequency and it's -- those are the 2 things that we're addressing. And as I noted in my comments, we are piloting a predictive analytics tool for commercial auto, and we're about to implement that in a couple of states. And we're hopeful that over the next couple of months, we'll be able to analyze the results, and with the intention of being able to roll that out through all the geographical areas where we write commercial auto."

We've been facing uncertainty in our business, a result of a highly competitive and evolving retail environment, the trade war and the impact of tariffs, and the team has been working very hard to transform our company as part of Operation North Star. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I'm confident we will navigate through this environment to deliver a good outcome for 2019. And I'm also confident that 2020 will be a year of significantly improved performance for the company as the fruits of all these efforts start to be realized."

What I mean by that is, if a company is public and/or regulated, obviously, compliance tends to weigh in a little heavier than it does when that's not true, right? A smaller or a nonregulated industry company, security and operational issues tend to be more at the forefront. And just to echo what Cam said, I think in the world of IT products of any sort, even security, if there is a value proposition to be discussed, relative to cost management or cost reduction, it's always a great way to get the dialogue going. And that's an even better dialogue if they're replacing, displacing older legacy technology that they know has become somewhat costly to maintain and inefficient to use. So I think we quite often get people's attention on compliance and/or security. But a lot of times, when you get into the sales cycle and are helping them do an ROI, what we call a business value assessment, and justify this up their chain of command up through the financial organization, quite often, the operational issues are pretty significant."

The benchmark Brent crude price rose 9% year-on-year to average at $50 per barrel, with several unplanned outages as well as geopolitical tensions. Naphtha prices rose in tandem with crude oil, pushing up petrochemical product prices amidst tighter supply and stronger demand. With this improved market scenario, PCG recorded a 24% year-on-year increase in revenue at MYR 4 billion compared to MYR 3.2 billion in the corresponding quarter. This is the result of higher sales volume and improved product prices supported by favorable foreign exchange impact. EBITDA for the quarter was MYR 1.5 billion, an increase of 26% from that recorded in the same quarter last year, driven by higher volume, improved spread and favorable foreign exchange movement. However, EBITDA margin maintained at a healthy level of 38%. Profit after tax surged by 92% to MYR 1 billion from MYR 533 million."

In vitro for these compounds, there is no real difference between them.

I think sort of first and foremost is the sort of understanding and the optimization of Sukari, I think, is a clear short-term focus, and that's the foundation on which, I think, the next phase of the company will be -- growth will be built on. So I think that's a clear focus. And obviously, we have the life of asset review, which has been already initiated and is underway keenly to understand that. And I think importantly as well, when we look at sort of the growth opportunities, there's -- one of the things I'm keen to look at is capital allocation and competition for capital. An ability to diversify away from Sukari, clearly, have some advantages around both country and the operational risk diversification. But in terms of brownfield expansions, sort of competition for capital, we'll have to look carefully at where we get the best bang for our buck as well. So I think, first and foremost, getting Sukari right and understanding the levers of Sukari for investment and what that can return is a key focus on that."

That accounts for light-duty diesel deterioration being offset by growth in the heavy-duty diesel business as well as the power electronics and the gas technologies. I think in -- the way to think about it, if you focus on that roughly $950 million of revenue -- light-duty diesel revenue in Powertrain, about $550 million of that is pass car. So it's a relatively small number when you start to frame it. The rest light-duty diesel is actually commercial vehicles not under the same types of pressures sort of, what I call, political and social pressures is light-duty pass car. So that's $550 million we see coming down and say it halves over the forecast period. So your -- we can ring fence that revenue leakage pretty -- it's a pretty straightforward calculation."

And so -- and those are 2 distinct -- they run 2 distinct R&D facilities. And so those 2 products, platforms were designed independently of each other. So even though they're both owned by Canon, that doesn't make them an end-to-end solution. It means they have now components that can be put together to make a system, but they weren't designed from the ground up as an end-to-end solution like Avigilon. And if you throw in the mix as well the parent company being Canon, our reports indicate that the Canon product and Canon sales organization is still actively selling against Axis and Milestone, and vice versa.

Virtually all the improvement was due to increased earnings with negligible effect from shares outstanding. The effect of currency translation on quarterly results was slightly positive, but not significant. As mentioned in the previous comments, the vast majority of the sales increase over Q1 2016 was due to volume improvements. The larger shares of sales increase came from Utility Support Structures, where sales growth also realized in the Irrigation and Energy and Mining. The increases in Engineered Support Structures and Coating sales were due to increased sales to other Valmont segments. This is a good example of how we leverage capabilities across geographies and segments to create a more effective global supply chain.

We expect to complete the divestiture of Bontonfilm in the Czech Republic during the second quarter. And we are actively engaged in a process involving a number of interested parties to sell our other non-core assets. While most of the assets that we have identified as non-core are in Romania and the Czech Republic, it is important to emphasize that they are completely separable from our core broadcasting assets in those countries, without any significant impact on their future performance. The broadcast assets in these countries are not just core. Because of their history, size and strategic importance they are the heart of our company and central to its future growth. That growth begins this year, and is evident in the improvements to financial performance that we have already seen in the first quarter. Based on our view of the markets in each of the countries in which we operate, we currently anticipate OIBDA for 2014 to be between $80 million and $90 million. And following closing of the financing transactions, we continue to believe we are positioned to be free cash flow positive beginning in 2015. And now back to Christoph for a few closing words."

We're not expecting for any significant change in the European economy going forward. So it's getting the cost structure in line with the level of business that we're currently conducting there. We would expect to get benefit from that initially in the second half of this year, and I think Larry mentioned a number of around $5 million that we expect to generate this year, most of that being in the fourth quarter, and then the annualized effect of that going into 2013 will be significant. As I mentioned also, Europe is still an important part of our strategy. It's a big, meaningful market for both us and the world. There's still a lot of growth potential in Europe, not only in the more mature countries within Europe, but in the Middle East and Africa, which is all part of our European market.

And so -- and we're very confident that we haven't lost market share in that segment of our business. But hope that over time, that business will come back. Predicting when that's going to occur is very tough for us. On the CamelBak side, I think it's a bit less relevant in terms of pent-up demand. I think that because most of their business is really not Department of Defense-driven or even sequester-driven, I think it's more driven by troop deployment levels than anything. So I think as troop deployment levels continue to come down or stabilize at a certain level, I think CamelBak's military business will perform in accordance with that level of military staffing. Should those troop levels increase or another conflict were to develop that led to deployment, I think that we would expect CamelBak's military business to increase accordingly. But I don't think the kind of ongoing development or coming out of sequester is really an impact that will be felt by CamelBak in any material way. Elias, would you add anything to the Advanced Circuits comments as it relates to business related to the sequester?"

So if VW and Audi really get into trouble, they now have Tata with a huge investment in Range Rover and things like that. So we checked -- of course, given that not only Slovakia but Hungary and the Czech Republic all are rather heavy on the car manufacturing side, we really checked the effect that would have, on us, on economic growth in the country and in our performance. And for the moment, we believe that even sort of if Volkswagen gets into real trouble, the real effect on GDP growth in that country and then also on us will be quite a bit lower than we would have thought, actually. So on the consolidation, in Austria, your colleagues asked me before what would be my main goal for the next year. My main goal would be that we really build an outstanding, flexible, digital database throughout the group based on a common product catalog and common processes so that, whenever that's done, we're able to link in whoever would like to join our group.

And probably the biggest difference is cloud adoption. Certain countries are more ahead on cloud adoption, the U.S., the U.K., Australia, really Northern Europe. Interestingly, Japan is really coming on where cloud adoption is getting stronger. And that's partly driving our strong Japanese growth. And Germany is probably a half step behind on cloud adoption and dealing with more some of the German security and data localization issues. And so I think that offers real growth opportunity in the coming years as Germany begins, and many of the large multinationals in Germany begin, to embrace cloud more fundamentally. And so we're positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage of it. And then last thing I'll just reiterate is from the -- as I said a few minutes ago, the governments -- state, regional, local and federal governments in literally Australia, the U.K, other parts of Europe, the U.S. are adopting cloud more aggressively, and that's generating underlying demand for our platform and frankly, the other cloud platforms."

We are linked to macroeconomic factors, so this correlation with the GDP is very strong. And also, growth in imports. The link to the growth in the GDP, growth in consumption. So with imports growing, the trend is to have a price increase, also an improvement in the mix, better usage, especially the retro area in the port and a good balance between offer and demand. But if we have a growth of the GDP above 2%, which is what we expect this year, the port will have a growth of 10%. 2 years of 10% growth in the port will give us a more balanced situation between offer and demand. And there is a strong demand to slowly recover prices -- prices to recover. I believe this will happen. We've seen signs of the price recovering."

The quarter, for the most part, met our financial expectations as Ultrasound grew 5% on a constant currency basis and Medical Imaging was flat. The one exception, as Jim noted, was our Security segment experienced delay issues leading to a 39% revenue decline, which was the primary cause of the overall 5% revenue drop or 4% on a constant currency basis. The positive news within the quarter was strong gross margin improvement of 3 points driven by favorable product mix and continued cost reductions offset lower revenue volume. Gross margin expansion led to a 2-point improvement on overall non-GAAP operating margin. Now we believe a significant portion of the gross margin improvement is sustainable, but some of the mix benefit may not continue in the second half."

But when the snow went away, the sales popped right back up to good same-store sales trends. We got hit in the mid-South, which always destroys us. Memphis; Nashville markets; Atlanta got some bad weather, which is very rare. But these markets have all bounced back. Our West End restaurant here in Nashville is one of our stronger, same-store sales performers in the quarter. We don't really see any geographic sales issues, except some sales softness in the Atlanta market for Stoney and J. Alexander's is continuing. Those restaurants are, sort of, up 1 point one week and down 2 points the next week. Fortunately, our exposure is not that great. With the exception of the Cumberland Mall restaurant where the lunch program continues to grow and grow and grow. That restaurant is usually in the top 2 or 3 Stoneys. But on a national basis, we see good sales in Michigan. Ohio's pretty stable. Most of the other markets, Florida, all of our restaurants have been up in the first quarter, except for 1. That's pretty normal when we get competition and different things from time to time. So our outlook for both operating groups, minus the weather, I would say, is very strong."

So settlement of potential claims under that insurance coverage could be a challenge. One could not transact in U.S. dollars for one.

So there's still issues to be sorted out following some big political decisions and to see if you can make this operational. On the U.S. side, I think there's limited flow for now.

In the Philippines, for the recon investment, which is very small in terms of the operating impact, and in Poland, we have tax credits. We can't utilize tax credits on losses. You just think of it intuitively. So we have to -- when we book a loss, we book no tax offset to that loss. No net operating loss carryforward. So $1 or EUR 1 of pretax loss is the same after-tax. That's causing what appears to be a higher effective income tax rate in the first quarter because it's primarily losses out of Poland. That will swing to a significant tax benefit once we have taxable earnings, which we expect again to have in the second half of the year. So the first quarter tax rate is high because of that technical issue with losses in 2 countries where we have tax credits. Otherwise, we'd be in that 34%, 35% effective tax range."

And I think for a company of our size to have come out of the 2008 storm and the difficult operating environment in Zimbabwe, bear in mind, we had to cease production for six months at the end of 2008 beginning 2009, Caledonia has come an enormously long way, and we've done it with our own cash without having to dilute shareholders."

That being said, we have maintained our process of selectivity that we have done throughout our portfolio, including on our downstream portfolio, in petrochemicals, our refining and fertilizers that you saw us secure very successfully in 2018. So in regards to LNG, we think we are well-positioned. We are tracking over 20 projects globally. We have focused on 5 strategic projects. Interestingly there, over 5 different countries, we have 7 different partners or potential partnerships across those projects.

It is quite likely that the depth of the economic crisis and the time frame for recovery will differ significantly across our major geographies. It will be important to remember that the U.K., which comprises 29% of our revenues, will be recovering from the corona-induced recession at the same time as it negotiates the details of Brexit, which is likely to continue to produce its own economic headwinds in South Africa, from which we derive 11% of our revenues. The current crisis appears to be significantly impacting this already weakened economy, the clearest measure of which is the fact that the rand has devalued 21% in value against the dollar over the past year.

One is that Venezuela represents around 2% of our net income, the consolidated net income, before it was representing a larger portion, and Venezuela is the one that has the higher effective tax rate closer to 40%. Second is -- point is that as we have the new production plant in Colombia, we have also, it's like a tax-free zone where some of the value-added taxes are 0 or very small. But also, we have a lower income tax number for that -- the company that owns that production plant. And as we are shifting more volume to that plant, our total Colombia effective tax rate is also coming down. And the rest is basically looking for efficiencies in every country in trying to be as efficient as possible that's always complying with laws -- with the tax law in every country, no? But the 2 main impacts is the fact that Venezuela is now a smaller portion of our consolidated number and the fact that this production plant in Colombia has a special treatment with respect to income tax. Going forward, I think that should be -- going forward, just so everyone can be clear, before we were saying that somewhere around 30% was a good effective tax rate.

And you mentioned in particular where it's occurring, Australia, there was -- Australia and Brazil. And the reason I call out those 2 is because they're the major suppliers to China. And with the China slowdown, that has impacted the raw materials and the resources coming from the more heavily mining-centric economies. We also see continued slowness in mining in South Africa. And that has to do a little bit with some of the labor unrest there, but probably a little stronger because of the pricing of the precious metals. Mexico, the mining continues to be strong. Canada, I think, we're having strong sales there, but we do see that slowing as we go forward. So a pretty mixed bag at this point in time with respect to mining.

We have the vast majority of the number of units, and we have -- we really have our stand-alone machine. So the small FLEX, as Bob was saying, is a great small footprint to use in these nontraditional locations, which we think is going to be necessary to fill out the country. So no confirmation yet, but we feel very positive about that part of the contract."

In terms of our order books from now till December, our order books in these plants are full. So if we are able to get a little benefit of political stability and continuity of workers reporting on to work and no real civil unrest in the country, no security threat, we believe that we will start seeing a jump in the margin from this quarter itself because as I told you July was fairly good, and we're hoping that the normalcy will restore there. So it is about a quarter getting impacted because of one plant, and it's a quarter -- if the plant comes back, we should see the turnaround in what you say in this quarter itself and then only the numbers moving up."

And yes, it's kind of a little bit of a dichotomy that you have to be good in consumer, to be good in enterprise because, right now, it is actually also the employee and the enterprise deciding which device makes it into the enterprise. So from that perspective, there is segmentation in the enterprise, which is, \"Where can I deploy consumer-ish devices without having too much of a security concern? And where do I really need the full-blown BlackBerry security?\" So there is kind of, a, you got to be good in consumer, but you got to be differentiated in the enterprise play here. And this is what we are doing with BlackBerry. What we are providing is, based on our experience in security, to bring a good level of security to iOS and Android devices, which gives peace of mind to CIOs. But that -- absolutely, the full management experience and the security experience on BlackBerry is unmatched. That's the way we look at it at the moment. And as I said, I think Richard asked the question, right now, customers look at us to provide them an end-to-end solution still, and we can't break that paradigm."

The pricing has been more aggressive, right, which, all along, we've said we would see the biggest impact at launch in that first year, and then it would taper off as we got to the follow-on years. And I think what we've seen play out now only supports that further. So I think you can expect a much bigger impact in 2019 in the countries that had an impact, and then it will slow as we get into 2021. Now there will be countries that come on in the later years, and they'll experience probably a similar kind of curve as we enter those markets.

And if we are going to have the Israel market as the benchmark, and I know that a more visionary goal, the potential growth in Sabra is really big, and we are in the beginning of the journey.

The second one is the improvement of the labor mix, which is also, as Mark said, moving activities where possible and faster into the low-cost countries. And then the third one was that we want to do a better job in maximizing our global infrastructure in terms of where we are and what locations we are and the utilization of those locations. So that's the MAP. And as Mark said, that also, of course, has a benefit to CRS. In addition, to this, of course, we do also have other productivity programs in the company. And as Joe referred to earlier, one of them has to be, for instance, the people we took on board last year now get to the learning curve, where their availability is similar to the availability we expect from all our employees in that type of business.

We have to be selective and not be all things to all people. But at the same time, in both businesses, we will be utilizing cash to grow the business. So before I used to say, we are starting to look at acquisitions. Year 2 of our strategic plan, we need to grow our revenue base. We need to position ourselves for year 3, and that will mean utilizing some of our cash, hopefully. Little bit -- we have to be realistic here to grow the top line and get us into new markets. So what I think you're going to see is Yuval pushing into new markets organically, or you're going to see Gordon pushing into new countries in effect, slowly, carefully.

I don't know if there will be a kind of emerging markets concern or emerging market capital requirement. What we do see today is that there are some idiosyncratic issues that some countries have, and that they will have to probably address. And that's basically it. So that will be my 2 answers, Alex."

Attendees of this event heard these utilities describing with clarity their business case for deploying private LTE. They addressed numerous specific use cases explaining why it was critical for the industry to work together to share development resources, to capture economies of scale with vendors and to attract innovative developers of applications. Through these initiatives, we believe a collective industry vision is developing. And utilities are now hearing it from their own leadership in their own words, which will in turn impact the strategic thinking in the war rooms and the Board rooms of utilities and their regulators throughout the nation."

Infusion Consumables had revenues of $136 million, which was a 23% increase year-over-year on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. We had 24% growth in the U.S. market and 10% international growth, even with some negative performance year-over-year in Asia. Both core infusion therapy and oncology growth were over 20% in the U.S. market, which is extremely important to us, and we had stronger sequential growth in oncology. We felt positive about our growth products and our performance in the market sets us up well for the balance of the year. The rest of the world opening up could be additive to this, but we are cautious on a few selected geographies that are delayed in opening. As we highlighted on the last call, Q2 of 2020 was severely impacted in the U.S. market downward.

Given persistent concerns surrounding further economic weakness in Europe, questions about the sustainability of economic recovery in the U.S., the upcoming U.S. presidential election and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain cautious going into 2012. We are, however, encouraged by the sales pipeline activity and conversion rates from certain existing and new clients within the Americas and EMEA regions. Areas of demand include financial services, communications, healthcare and transportation verticals. However, the underlying run rate demand among subset of clients is expected to remain sluggish. That, along with tough year-over-year comparisons due to programs that generated revenues last year, but are now end-of-life is expected to more than offset the pace of new business. Revenue comparisons between 2012 and 2011 are also expected to remain skewed as 2011, included approximately $24 million in revenue contribution from South Africa, Ireland, and the Netherlands, which the company is expected to exit as part of the previously-announced strategic actions. Furthermore, we expect roughly $15 million in unfavorable foreign currency impact to 2012 revenues relative to 2011. Separately, 2012 quarterly revenues are anticipated to exhibit seasonality, particularly a weaker second quarter relative to the first quarter due to fewer workdays resulting from public holidays. We believe that 2012 to 2011 quarterly revenue comparisons should turn favorable in the fourth quarter of 2012."

But China to the U.S. is increasing, and that's kind of a paradox because you would think that this trade war would be working 2 ways. And we're scratching our heads, quite frankly, a little bit in terms of why that is happening. And I think one of the possible explanations can be, if you speak to the container lines, actually you're seeing a little bit of the same impact on container volumes. And some people in the container industry feels that the explanation could be that if the Chinese government tells the Chinese corporations not to buy U.S. products anymore, they will stop doing it. But if the U.S. economy asks Walmart, \"Don't buy products in China,\" Walmart's going to say, \"Well, we're going to continue buying it as long as it makes economic sense.\" So there's probably less control in terms of shutting off that import. Whether that's actually the case or not, it's really hard to find out. But the fact of the matter is that you are actually seeing increased trade from China to U.S. on some commodities. So the bottom line is for the trade war, at least as it is now, and it also seems to be trailing off a little bit, cooler heads are prevailing, but we do not see a major impact from the trade wars on the chemical tanker demand as it is today."

Actually, we don't think the weather -- well, we think that the weather had very little impact on our second quarter performance and again, we think the timing of our January price increase may have masked the impact from weather. Certainly, while a good portion of the U.S. experienced severe weather that limited construction, we believe our shipments didn't suffer much since our distributors received shipment of the orders that they placed earlier in the quarter. Relative to weather, we actually think that we could see maybe a little impact from weather in our -- in the third quarter as weather could impact the timing of our distributor sales and reorder. In fact, we think that weather impeded construction in April and that could even spill a little bit into early May. We know that in parts of the Northeast and the Midwest, there are still load restrictions on heavy construction equipment and then there's flooding in other parts of the country. So really, I think that the weather could impact how quickly distributors turn their inventory this quarter once delayed projects are released. But since we had this pull forward of orders, since we were able to ship them and our distributors were willing to take them, we probably didn't have much of a weather impact in the second quarter."

But we're really kind of -- we're supplementing that with a lot of new team members, and those folks have been able to move some portfolios over. And so for us, I think net-net, we still feel very good about our ability to grow. If you get a little bit of economic tailwind, then yes, I think we could hit the higher end of the range.

And so for all of those reasons, we are being admittedly conservative when we say 10%. And there certainly is some upside opportunity with regard to capital utilization as we go forward. But as you know, we are conservative and we're going to be careful as we go through this because there's so much earnings power in this organization as we go forward. We will be able to provide extremely good returns, in my view, for our shareholders, but it's important not to rush it in terms of overleveraging the company in the beginning."

But what surprised us, I think, was the really strong performance in Texas that I think, for the most part, is not ACA related, and even the really strong performance in California that I think is beyond the ACA impact. So I mean, that's the sort of geographic kind of trends that -- or differences that I would point out.

I wonder if you'd care to comment on the drivers of the differential between your performance and that of your competitors, particularly with respect to how much of the 5-point gap between you and your peers is a result of you just having to yield on price to maintain volume as your portfolio ages? How much is a consequence of you losing accounts or losing volume to your peers? And how much of it is really a factor of your geographic mix, where you may happen to be overexposed in weaker markets? And the reason I ask is, it really -- it goes to our confidence that, with some new products, you'll be able to recover this business quickly. If it's just price you're having to yield in the short term, one would think that new products would allow you to get that back but if you are losing whole accounts, then you're dependent on winning those back, which is always a bigger task. Or if it's a geographic mix effect, then you're kind of reliant on the market conditions picking back up and new products will help but they certainly might not drive as quick a recovery.

Last night, we reported a record Q4 that resulted in full year revenue and EPS that exceeded our expectations. These results were driven by strategic investments we made throughout the year in domestic demand generation, China go-to-market improvements, technology supporting connectivity, navigation and mapping, advancements in product quality, exploring adjacent Home Robot markets and supporting demand generation efforts of our overseas partners. We also took steps to become more focused on the large home market and to fuel future growth. We created better nuanced messaging of Roomba, driving sell-through and further adoption, successfully launched our first connected robot, Roomba, using vSLAM navigation to dynamically create and update maps. We reallocated R&D resources from the next-generation Remote Presence platform to home opportunities. We began to reinvigorate overseas Home Robot growth, and we identified potential acquirers for our Defense & Security business. As a result of these efforts, Home Robot revenue grew more than 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by sales in the United States and China, which were up 46% and more than 70%, respectively, over Q4 in 2014.

In the near term, we expect e-commerce volumes to remain elevated, although perhaps moderated somewhat from what we experienced in the second quarter. In July, we again saw marketplace GMV exceed $1 billion and eclipse December 2019 levels, our fourth such consecutive month, although down about 8% compared to the average monthly GMV levels we saw in the second quarter. However, despite this modest deceleration compared to the second quarter, we still saw average daily GMV well above pre-COVID levels through the month of July. For comparison, July GMV was up 40% compared to July 2019, even though Amazon Prime Day occurred in July last year and has been postponed this year. Whether this strength in GMV we saw in July continues into August and September is difficult to predict, and with potential new flare-ups of COVID-19 in various geographic regions and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, it remains difficult to know how things will play out over the next few months, particularly the fourth quarter. For these reasons, we're going to stick with shorter-term floor guidance for the time being. Longer term, many industry analysts have taken a position that heightened e-commerce penetration is likely to remain permanent as consumer behaviors and shopping habits have shifted online.

So first of all, the first one, on the Ground Handling personnel development that you talked about that being more optimized, could you tell us a little bit more about the detail of that optimization? Was that mainly matching working hours to peak periods of demand? Or what else went on there? And how much of that is transferable into the remainder of the year and going forward? Second question, on the EUR 4 per spend head for the sort of medium-, longer-term target with sort of maybe a focus on less conspicuous consumption in some countries and also FX issues, are you still confident of the timescale of that or just that push out a bit? And then very finally, across your airport group, particularly on the more sort of leisure-orientated Eastern Mediterranean and Bulgarian airports, what proportion of your passengers either go to or from Russia? And how exposed are you in terms of Russian geographic exposure there?"

When you're -- we have a couple fires in plants both internationally, and that does require, when you have that to temporarily redirect waste for a period of time, and that will carry forward into Q4. And that does come at a cost to be able to move those waste flows. Also, you've seen large inflation pressures in certain Latin American countries, in which there are large unions that cover our workforce down there. And we're required by regulation and within our union contracts due to the inflation to do a large, kind of unexpected payroll increase. And again, obviously, that is going to continue through. The other thing that we've learned is that we've upgraded the compliance of all of our domestic incinerators to meet Title V  requirements. That those come at operating at a higher cost. And I think, Brent, could probably touch on that a bit of color to help you better understand why that happens."

If it was a more modern asset, let's say, post-Panamax asset where we have more visibility with regard to its ability and to retain value and earnings, it might have been a little different. Importantly, as I said, if you look at the -- if we were to market these vessels today and for sale, which is also what is indicated by the appraisal that we got, we would probably have -- we would probably get much more than we paid for. So what I'm trying to say is that I don't see many deals like that being offered around in the market with that type of returns. So -- and we are, as you say, the same people. So I think Capital Maritime, in a way, is also supporting the Partnership when it gives deals like that at prices like that at multiples of this sort. So I think we are getting the visibility and the security of income that we want, especially with more risky assets like this, and at the same time, we don't necessarily have to -- we cannot -- we don't necessarily have to look at this, let's say, part of the market and focus more on more stable assets."

So I think you started the year with a heavy supply of CMBS volume and then you had rates gap out, war, economic uncertainty that cause the spreads to gap out. So you have a bit of a double whammy both on spreads and rates. CMBS markets open, but if you don't have to issue in that market in size, it's probably a market you'd prefer not to go into right now and we don't need to go to that.

As I predicted at this year’s CAGNY conference, 2010 will be an ugly year, driven by weak consumer demand, rising commodity prices, increased pressure from the retailers and competitive price wars. But when things get ugly, you should place your bets on the company that has the product portfolio that thrives in such an environment and the management team that has the track record of knowing how to successfully leverage that portfolio to deliver strong EPS growth.

When I look at it from an overall -- when I look at it over a long period, I'm confident that we will win a good share of the project. Doesn't mean that we will win all project, obviously. And that -- so we try to balance our risk between geographical area and type of vessel, et cetera, and competition is doing the same.

As Scott pointed out, in the third quarter, there was some softness in demand, both because of underlying economic issues and also some unusual weather patterns which is why we said we think inventory is a little bit higher than normal for this time of the year in the channel. With that said, these markets have been, the southern European markets and northern Africa markets, where we've had political or financial uncertainty, have been uncertain for some time. So we don't see a compelling reason to see demand being further weakened from these levels. We are going into the off-season, so it will be choppy through the end of the year and into the first quarter next year until we see the seasonality kick in. But overall, again, we're a very large replacement business. We're continuing to expand our distribution in Europe, through the Middle East with the acquisition of Impo.

There is also a onetime tax-related items that reduced the tax rate by about 3%. So we're still consistent with our guidance that, assuming the current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we would anticipate a effective tax rate between 35% and 40%. If you unwind the 3% to a onetime impact in the third quarter, that takes you up to 35%. And if you look at year-to-date, our effective tax rate is about 37%.

It's common for a mid-cap or regional bank to have a distributed technology model that uses many different vendors. With the investments we're making, we'll be able to further consolidate our distributed model, which will drive a reduction in the overall number of vendors involved. This will reduce the per -- transaction fees we pay, improve the customer experience and address one of the key concerns that customers and regulators are focused on today, cyber security."

You are fully right that there is some discussion happening in a number of countries about a long-term potential ban and that's the first comment I would have, is I do anticipate there will be a continued discussion on this, because typically, of course, banning one technology is not necessarily always the best option. I think that the target of reducing CO2 output is very clear, of reducing emissions. And hopefully, there will be approaches where the steering is exactly towards that target, of reducing and minimizing emissions. So I anticipate still quite a lot of debate, whether banning one technology is the right approach, or whether it's more, just putting far tougher and tougher ambition on the regulation is a better approach. Then also allowing other technologies, other alternative fuel solutions to come into play. The other comment I would make is that, of course, it's also good to note that the discussion is very much around passenger cars. It is roughly 30% of the oil demand. So it's also important to note that the growing segments of heavy-duty aviation chemicals bunker date. They continue to be very important for us and we focus of course on those also a lot."

First, let me begin by giving you some insights about how the latest social and political context affect our performance in the different countries where we operate. Regarding Bolivia, we are currently operating at a medium industrial capacity. And in spite of roadblocks, there was not any material impact in our logistics and dispatches. However, if this context continues in the coming months, it might possibly affect the normalized operation of our business. Among other geographies such as Ecuador, Chile and Argentina, we haven't seen any material impact on our operations.

We've proven year in, year out that we could make money on that. You look at the strength of the West Coast of Florida. Of all the areas in this country, it probably is among the strongest because the people going there are older and they have money and they're less affected by this, and that's going to continue. It's got a tremendous history. So the combination of that, the breadbasket, the feed we can bring to it from where we fly, all the markers are incredibly strong. So while we're not going to put any capital into it at this point in time, longer term, as a strategy, I think that what we're embarked on is a diversification that's second to none in the industry. And we've got a great head start with that asset. So we certainly want to stay involved in some fashion to feed ourselves and continue to enhance third-party revenues.

Until now, we complained about nickel pig iron because it was a material that only was produced and consumed in China. And they couldn't export because of the export duties in China. Something that, by the way, we are trying to eliminate in the World Trade Organization. But, anyway, if they produce nickel pig iron, if the Chinese producers go to Indonesia or go to Philippines to produce nickel pig iron, this material, this raw material will be open for the rest of the world.

In fact, funding for the budget line items that support most of our work should remain relatively stable. This includes $204 billion for the operation and maintenance line item.  That's an 11% increase over 2010. It also includes $75 billion for the research, development, test and evaluation line item.  That's another important source of funding for our continuing work for the DoD. These funding levels are consistent with the DoD's commitment to using service contractors for highly-specialized technical and engineering services, firms like us.

Continued steps in this direction, focusing on approving a budget for fiscal 2018, executing the fiscal plan and improving Puerto Rico's competitiveness by first truly and once and for all transforming PREPA into an efficient open market low-cost energy provider will help restore confidence and certainty among people and businesses in Puerto Rico. And finally, allow much-needed capital to flow back into the island."

While we began to feel the impact of the work stoppage in the third quarter of 2019, its impact will be exponentially greater in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Budgets are going to be changing. They're going to be more closely scrutinized in the process to close transactions.

I want to spend a bit of time on the U.K. regulatory update, as political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. affected our stock price performance during the second half of 2017. We continue to believe, based on Ofgem's public comments and our meeting with them earlier this month, that we will have the opportunity to earn double-digit real returns in RIIO-2 as the top performer among electric DNOs in the U.K. Our meeting with Ofgem was very constructive, and I think both parties really listened to what the others had to say. Ofgem communicated to us that while they are there pleased with the outputs being generated by regulated networks under RIIO-1, they believe customers are paying too much for those outputs. This was especially evident in the transmission and gas distribution businesses, where the cost of equity was set much higher than for the electric DNOs, and overall returns on regulated equity in those sectors are higher than our sector.  However, even for the electric DNOs, they were expecting a much wider distribution of returns among the companies. As a result, we believe Ofgem's goal for RIIO-2 will be to bring the overall regulatory returns down for transmission and gas distribution and force much more differentiation for electric distribution while preserving the ability for the top performers to still earn a double-digit real return on regulated equity. Therefore, as we've been saying, while we agree to sector, in general, we'll see -- likely see lower returns, it is far too early to say that WPD will experience lower returns as the top-performing DNO."

And a lot of that unfortunately is tied to the fact that Mali has been their own worst enemy with respect to making that happen with the coup and the uncertainty. We've been there 17 years. We've never had a day of production lost to political instability. We're very comfortable with our position in Mali. We've had -- we had upwards of $300 million allocated for this expansion. And we're simply not going to move ahead and deploy capital without certainty. And as most of you know, my philosophy is, we're committed to deliver high rate of return projects, this is one of them. But until we have everything, all the Is dotted and Ts crossed, we're simply not going to do that. So for 2013, we had allocated upwards of $130 million for Sadiola. Until we have certainty, we're not going to be spending that money, and that obviously affects our capital profile and it also affects our production, which we've indicated. So we're doing the best we can with what we have there. And again, we're not driving the truck.

We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins and do it all in a capital-efficient approach. SFS 2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. And today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum."

As I already mentioned, the truck market, especially in Europe, could recover because some of the supply chain issues were resolved. There's still some concerns in Europe, obviously, due to the conflict and other items. But supply chain situation for the truck customer has improved considerably and with that, we have the 23% growth in the truck industry.  In trailers, 1% growth. There, we had a strong market already in the last year. So it continues to be on a high level. The tractor markets contracted by 8%, mainly impacted due to uncertainties of energy and rising costs and also some supply chain issues.  In that environment, JOST had an 18% growth, benefiting mainly from the recovery in the truck market and a good performance also in the other market segments."

For the full year fiscal '13 over fiscal 2012, also about 1 point in headwind. Now that's improved versus our Security Analyst Meeting when it was 2 points of headwind. But you -- you kind of alluded to it, we really need to think about the fact that HP is exposed to a whole basket of currencies. And we have different hedging strategies depending on the competitive business that we're in. And so, for example, in the services space, we hedge longer term than we do on a purely transactional business -- piece of business in the Personal Systems Group. It also depends on how quickly we can pass on changes in currency and pricing. And so that basket of currency and then the different hedging strategies really mutes the kind of the currency impact quarter-to-quarter in our business. From a supplies perspective, the depreciation in the yen didn't give as much of a benefit in Q2. It's more skewed to the second half and mostly in Q4 when we see the big ramp and that's really because of the contract that we have with Canon and the hedges that we had in place at the point of time that the yen started to depreciate. We do expect that our cost savings in the second half are creating quite a war chest for Japanese competitors and we're starting to see a more aggressive pricing. They now have a lower cost structure than they did before."

Big country, loving American brands, but we have to make sure that our brand -- because a lot of new brands are coming into China, and every time something comes in, that is the bright shiny object. So keeping our name front and center and really putting money behind marketing has been a strategic call we've made, probably a little greater dollar investment than we envisioned 2 years ago when we first put this on a piece of paper, but we are getting the benefit of brand awareness. And if we weren't getting that, we'd be the first people, because most people in the call know us well, that we would not be advocating and telling everybody we're going to open 30 stores in 2012 if we didn't feel the acceptance of the brand.

That said, weakened sentiment of delay in announcement of CapEx plans by potential clients across the operational geographies, coupled with diligent choice of orders, has actually translated into subdued but high-quality order booking during the quarter. Nevertheless, total carryforward order book at INR 6,149 crores as at 30th June, 2021, provides an adequate level of forward revenue visibility. The carryforward order book for domestic projects at INR 3,702 crores contained a mix of orders across water, H-VAC, rural electrification, solar and urban infra activity.

Canadian Retail delivered strong earnings growth of 8%, driven by good growth in loans, deposits and wealth assets, net of margin compression, lower credit losses, higher insurance earnings and positive operating leverage. U.S. Retail earnings grew 21%, reflecting good organic growth and the stronger U.S. dollar. In U.S. dollars, earnings grew by 5% due to strong loan and deposit growth, steady credit performance, good expense management and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by margin compression and lower security gains. Wholesale Banking earnings increased 7% this year due largely to strong top line growth. The corporate segment loss increased in 2015 due largely to nonrecurring positive items in 2014. We were pleased to achieve positive operating leverage for the year. We finished the year with a CET 1 ratio of 9.9%. Overall, a good performance from our businesses in 2015."

We have seen this continuous overperformance in almost all markets driven by, for instance, in China because we indicated in China, sales or volume development, relatively weak. On the passenger and commercial vehicle side, it's actually declined this year. Still, the tighter emission regulations in those markets like China, like in India, which started stage 6, a key driver for an increased share of volatility because the client base in these development countries are more and more looking for Engineered Joining Technology rather than using a scotch tape or a paper tape because they recognize that the emission regulations can only be met with a fully fledged assortment of joining technology. And that's exactly where we are coming in. That's exactly where our engineering teams are helping our customers to meet that tighter emission regulations. And that is one of the key drivers of our overperformance relative to market growth. And of course, the backlog scenario supports that view, as you pointed out, double-digit backlog growth versus the year 2017, which indicates that despite of relatively weak production as well as GDP numbers as well as the overly indicated trade barriers. And certainly, that supports volatility. And volatility, normally, is never good for growth.

This quarter, we are very pleased with the success of our new service lines launched earlier this year. The first example is our vendor security management service. The third-party vendors to our customers are an increasing threat to their enterprise. Many times, our customers do not possess the expertise in manpower to proper vet and manage the risks those suppliers pose to the data and systems that they manage for the hospital. This is also another example of where our integration efforts are beginning to pay off.

You have here on the left-hand side the corporate portfolio is EUR 326 billion of the total EAD, approximately 1/3, and you can see that there is no high concentration of problematic sectors. Although, obviously, as you would expect, most of our provisioning is around some specific sectors, such as oil and gas, shipping, aircraft. We have little exposure to LBOs, less than EUR 5 billion. And as we already said that with Diony a few months ago, we have a very strict discipline in terms of structures in LBOs and underwriting commitment so that we can come back on that later. And on retail, we have a very well-diversified geographical exposure. And let me stress the fact that as far as mortgages are concerned or home loans are concerned in countries such as France, which is where we have the bulk of our mortgages, you have the high securities through insurance schemes.

But I can tell you on the frontline, and this is very subjective, the representatives score the leads based on their interpretation of the quality of that, and that is about 5% better than last year.

Our goals were to respond to the FDA's Complete Response Letter, or CRL, and prepare to file our marketing authorization application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. In December, we resubmitted our lorcaserin New Drug Application, or NDA, which we believe addresses the FDA's CRL. We and Eisai are preparing for our Advisory Committee Meeting that is tentatively scheduled for May 10, as well as the June 27 PDUFA date. Earlier this month, we submitted the MAA, and we expect the EMA will accept the filing later this month. The next milestone for this application will be our receipt of the 120-day list of questions. We look forward to working with the EMA and our rapporteur and co-rapporteur during the centralized review process and to the potential approval of lorcaserin in EU member countries."

Results were further pressured by the typhoon in September. RevPAR growth in China increased nearly 3% during the quarter. China growth was tempered, however, by the recent introduction of a nationwide VAT tax. We expect RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region to increase in the mid-single digits for the full year, with RevPAR in China relatively stronger, in a similar range."

And I think the real challenge at Ingalls, we're excited about the destroyer competition that is already in play. The bids have been submitted, and frankly, we expect that award to be in the first half of 2013, which would add substantially to that backlog. And in fact, the Navy is even talking about the possibility of having 10 ships awarded as opposed to 9, and so that would be, we think, would be very positive.

Our amphib business is going to tail off by plan, and I think that as we work our way through the resource allocation in the fiscal discussions, I think amphibs and the role of the Marines have and the role of the Navy has in for deploying and being expeditionary are going to be very front and center for all the stakeholders and we expect to be very prominent in that discussion."

But the inventory, while it's only down $3 million from September, we made a major decrease in the inventory in the U.S. It went from $51 million down to $43 million.

The way we calculate funds remains unchanged. That is a firm order for which funding has been authorized. So we have that metric today about $4.1 billion, which is generally in line with where we ended Q3 absent that delayed impact of the particular contract Denise referenced as which was TAC-SWACAA, which is a couple hundred million less than initially expected just due to timing of a service order process. So in general, the unfunded orders include basically firm orders and potential options on multi-year contracts, which I think is fairly standard throughout the industry and it does exclude IDIQs and protested contracts that do have a higher degree of uncertainty as far as future realization and timing."

And overall, despite the multiple disturbances there, it seems to be going fairly well in terms of advancing that product ecosystem even during the lockdown there."

But if we compare the situation now against what we had a year ago, there has been clear progress. First of all, there had been widespread changes in governments in countries where they were having difficult problems in achieving their fiscal targets. Secondly, during 2011, we've seen fiscal adjustments and corrections in order to achieve the budget targets by the end of 2013. The measures taken at the end of 2011 by the European Central Bank have clearly lightened the tension in the markets. And with the negotiations on Greek debt coming to an end, it's been possible to bring down the risk premium for peripheral countries bit by bit, and that means a lower interest payment cost for these countries and their banking sectors. The crisis, however, has had an impact on the financial sector, especially on 4 key areas. First of all, capital and liquidity. On the situation of risks, in a very general sense of the word and then the results, the earnings of the sector. And that's where BBVA, yet again, has managed to stand out, outperforming its peers in all these areas. In capital, we're going to comply with the new EBA capital recommendations of 9% capital ratio by June 2012. And by 2012, as we move into 2012, we're already on a very sound financial footing."

Our adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the fourth quarter. While there are some good signs of performance in the quarter, which we'll talk about in a minute, we also incurred an earlier and more severe level of influenza expense than in prior years, as Ken just mentioned. The more severe early flu season cost us approximately $15 million more than the average of the prior 2 years or $0.22 in the quarter. The vast majority of the flu cost hit us in the month of December in Medicaid and was more prevalent with the CHIP and aged, blind and disabled populations. Our experience matched up with the external markers from a geography standpoint with more severe incidents in Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri. Since December, which appears to be the peak for Medicaid, we have seen a tapering off of flu with respect to the Medicaid population but we have seen a modest uptick in Medicare, which was not a pressure point in the fourth quarter."

In volume, the big 5 carry about 50% of the hemophilia market. I would expect that of the total market, they would represent closer to 70% in value. Germany, among the big 5 in volume, is about 1/4. And so it's quite a significant part. And if you look at the relative value of Sweden and Ireland and Scotland, which are the other key markets where we've had access and sales, I may be missing 1 or 2 small markets. But it's together, they would be in the single digits. So I think the proportion of our markets, Germany is as, by far, the largest single contributor and will continue to be. When you look at England, Italy and France and Spain coming on board, then that really brings us from that level of about 25% up to closer to 65%, 70%, I would guess. But I'm saying guess because, while we have very good data on volumes, we have far less good data on values. So it's a lot harder to estimate this specific revenue potential for each country.

As an early indication of further recovery, in Q3, we secured nearly 60% more design wins than Q2 for our Toggle products, giving further indication of longer-term growth potential for these products. The recent resolution of the trade conflict at the core of the previously discussed China factory automation segment challenges seems finally in hand and may bring relief as the sector recovers. Although certain challenges still exist in some of these areas, the current overall trend seems to be positive, as indicated by an increase in the number of customers ordering as well as continued healthy distributor inventory levels."

In 2012, we had $2.4 million in political revenue; but in 2013 Q4, we had only $200,000. So quite a dramatic difference. If political revenue is excluded from both quarters, our revenue would have grown 7.6%, and our adjusted EBITDA would have increased 10.3%. So there was some real progress made in our core businesses, which we think bodes quite well for 2014 with the potential revenue impact of the midyear election in 2014 added to this growing base.

In the 9 months of 2011, the decline of domestic sales volumes has been dramatic, and coupled with the shutdown of export markets in North Africa, has led capacity utilization of our plants to historically low levels. The decline of sales has come across all products and market segments with across-the-board pricing pressures. In general, the increase in uncertainty regarding the political and the economic prospects of the country are severely affecting demand for building materials both in the private as well as in the public sector. In the private sector, continued sharp reductions in employment, a drop in real disposable income and an elevated tax burden on real estate properties discourage construction decisions. Furthermore, lack of credit availability from banks and a still high outstanding stalk of houses for sale weakened the prospects of residential investment stabilization. However, regarding public works, they recently announced agreement with the EU to lower the share of national contribution in order to access structural funds to 5% from 27% previously, is expected to support the recovery in public investment activity going forward. For Titan, productivity initiatives, reduction of SG&A expenses by 13% and sale of excess carbon emission rights supported operational profitability.

So it was a financial benefit from a cash perspective and GAAP accounting required some additional expense. Excluding these swap-related items to the unique items with respect to interest expense, interest expense was up about $1 million in the quarter versus first quarter a year-ago. The tax rate in the quarter was in the 40 to 45% range excluding the unique items and reflects really a geographic mix issue in the quarter compounded by the low level of earnings both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And it is what it is in the quarter, that reflects our actual experience.

Now we -- big states for us and competitive states include Florida, Colorado, certainly, will be big in terms of revenue growth in political. California also has some potential. New Mexico. Texas, certainly, there with the governor race. We think 1 of the things that certainly continues to help us and we certainly are supportive of getting more Latinos to the polls and more -- and the Latino vote is having more success in terms of deciding the outcomes in some of these states with 5% or 6% -- representing 5% to 6% of the votes. So we certainly saw that in 2012 when we doubled our political revenue from $8 million to $16 million. Now we don't expect to do that this year because it's a midterm, but we do expect increases, as I've described them, and we continue to be positive about the Latino voter turnout."

We look forward to another year of solid sales and earnings growth despite a tougher global macroeconomic climate. There are 3 important factors to keep in mind as we think about 2015. Firstly, let me address our expectations for revenue growth. We expect revenue growth in constant dollars of around 7%. We expect lower commodity costs and currency-related inflationary pressure on governments in many countries will combine to create a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovations. Conversely, we are hopeful a stronger economic climate in the United States will allow us to continue to recover, through price, the investments made in innovation and product improvement over the past 5 years."

This margin improvement is based on the following topics: COVID-19 measures had the largest share in supporting profitability in quarter 2 2020. Please keep in mind that the measures are predominantly of a short-term nature. We have sold the loss-making Powertech unit by the end of quarter 3 2019. Accretive aftermarket share increase in quarter 2 2020 due to OE postponements and some pull-in effects. Fast recovery in China supported operating leverage in the country. Many of these positive topics arose specifically in the second quarter of 2020 and will only have a limited impact in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect a positive overall development of RVS profitability until year-end, but at a more normalized level."

But according to us, the Indian production will be about 34.5 million to 35 million bales. And with the opening stock of 3.6 million bales as on 1st October, 2018 and with the import of 1.5 million bales, consumptions of 32 million bales, export of 4.5 million bales, the total take off will be about 36.5 million bales. Ending stock will be about 3.1 million bales. So there will be a reduction in stock or this is the possible the country may export more cotton. Already [ 22.5 ] million bales have already been exported from the country up to 31st January, 2019. And this 4.5 million bales export we are taking on the very conservative side. If there is a more export, then there will be further reduction in the stock. This is all about the international situation and as far as the Indian cotton situation is concerned. But if we compare the cotton prices, which were prevailing in the month of December, January and February year '17, '18 versus this year and looking to the dollar-rupee relationship at that time with range of $0.63 to $0.64 -- INR 64, in terms of U.S. cents, this year the cotton is competitively cheaper, one.

So having the strong capitalization enables us to both weather the storm or the bad weather, whatever -- in whatever form it comes, and it also allows us to capitalize on the opportunity that is created from a higher-margin, lower-liquidity environment.

First was that Q3 EBITDA level reflects a strong impact of lockdown measures on the economy across many important countries for the group. Our balanced geographic footprint, diverse end market exposure and also product innovation helped us weather the downturn. Sales were down 15% -- 15.6% to be exact and volumes around 12% in Q2, reflecting declines in the transportation, construction and industrial market, especially."

We are doing a lot of work in the background to ensure that Everest becomes better in terms of customer offerings, in terms of customer connect, in terms of our productivity, quality and so on. I think we will see the impact of those in times to come. However, situation remains uncertain at best, how this whole COVID situation will play out with this opening up, whether the number of infections from 2 lakhs, where will they go, whether they will really infect rural India or the so-called heard immunity will start kicking in, and the virus would not really go into large numbers. These are all factors, which we have to watch and see. From our side, we are making the company far more efficient, far more productive, far more conscious of costs, far more conscious of premiums, far more conscious of the new position which we have taken in the marketplace. And we think that though immediate future may be a little clouded, we don't know how it's going to pan out, just like the way you are having Nisarga right now, little cloudy. But we think that we will be -- we will emerge from this significantly leaner, significantly stronger, significantly improved performance."

    "text": "As respect to the effective tax rate, with our changing portfolio and geographic mix, the third quarter of 2017 tax rate on pretax operating income of minus 7.4% requires some clarification. The U.S. property and casualty companies within the U.S. tax group, although incurring material underwriting losses due to the catastrophic events discussed previously, had these losses overshadowed by a gains emanating from our U.S. mortgage unit. This put the U.S. tax group in a taxpaying position, even though the company overall sustained operating losses. The underlying effective annual tax rate grew to 19% even for the year for the same basic reason, which is a lower level of estimated full year operating income than was forecast as of last quarter. The increase in the estimated effective annual tax rate causes the first 2 quarters of 2017 to be reevaluated at this now higher rate, and this impact reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. Therefore, this tax adjustment is directly derivative from the catastrophic loss estimates. And as a reminder, our tax rate is affected by varying mixes of income by geographical distribution and any associated changes on local tax rates. As for after-tax operating income earnings per share accretion realized in the third quarter from the UGC acquisition, we examined our results with and without the impact to the acquisition and the accretion remains consistent with past quarters and continues to move towards the initial 35% target."

The current year includes the impact of $3.4 million of additional cost of goods sold relating to the purchase accounting step-up in value of inventories relating to the Pramac acquisition. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, gross profit margin was 34.7%, an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year. The increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters, a favorable overall organic product mix, primarily due to a higher sales mix of residential products in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year, and the favorable impact of gross margin from the acquisition of Country Home Products.

For the first time since more than 2 years, sales growth has been achieved. Max Bahr showed even stronger sales growth based on its competence in the Gardening business. International sales continued to decline partly on the back of adverse general economic settings like in Greece and partly on the back of negative currency impact in many countries. The gross profit on sales increased as did the gross profit margin. Operating earnings were up. Working capital strongly improved. We had achieved a positive first quarter, therefore, we leave the outlook for 2012 unchanged.

Just to put in perspective, even if the surcharges do go into effect, given our geographic footprint, only about 2% of our global bookings are on and within the Lufthansa group. So it's relatively minor and quite manageable. But I think what's important is that those bookings largely would be expected to stay within the GDS system because Lufthansa continues to book there.

Is that final? And do you have now full clarity on the regulation? Then the second question that I have is on your Russian operations. In opening remarks, you said that the performance is strong and you consistently show now profitability of around 30%, both last year and this year. So I was wondering, is there a point which you essentially rethink your strategy of downsizing the operation and you focus more on growth and deploying perhaps more capital in the region? You referenced political risk, but perhaps you could maybe follow up on that and comment on what would you need to really see for you to be more comfortable to grow in the country?

First, the accelerator mission allows for reciprocal data rights back to UrtheCast, which, in turn, allows for SAR-XL data sales revenues much earlier than would otherwise have been the case and allows for building the customer base for OptiSAR data in advance of the constellation being launched. Secondly, the accelerator mission or missions significantly derisks OptiSAR technologically, financially and programmatically. Thirdly, at this time, UrtheCast's management and board believe that a pushout in the anticipated or target date for OptiSAR is prudent, in large part because that reflects the reality of the situation with the customers and also the reality of implementing a stand-alone SAR program as described. Fourth, the accelerator mission will provide UrtheCast with more time to sign further contracts and to arrange for the necessary export credit and project financing. Fifth, the accelerator mission will send what we think is a very significant signal to prospective OptiSAR customers that the technology and the program are real and that they significantly boost our credibility for being able to execute and deliver on programs of this scale. And finally, the accelerator mission gives our engineering services business strong revenue visibility for 3 years, 2018 to 2020, and, in effect, solving the standing army challenge that we faced from mid-2018 onward."

So I think that it is possible that we could be -- we could see that our bad debt remains low or even dip a little further in Q4. But in 2012, I don't think that we will see a sharp drop as we see the trend recently. If I may, I would like to add as well on the impact from flooding. Thailand is one of the country with a very high correlation between telecom revenue to GDP. And if GDP is expected by the World Bank to be revised downward, it is highly likely that telecom revenue will be impacted. If I don't remember wrong, I think the correlation level is up to 40% or 50%.

But we should see some improvement to our cost structure with 8 pesos to the $1. What we're evaluating is what is that impact on inflation. I don't mean to dominate the answer -- the time with an answer to this question, but Argentina is an important country to discuss, the issues are important to discuss. What we're considering is when we look at an inflation rate in the country at the present level, when we see the currency devalue from 6 pesos to 8 pesos to the $1, is the inflation already baked into an expectation that the currency would go to 8 pesos to the $1 dollar. Our expectation is that over the intermediate and longer term, the answer is yes. There might be some short term movement in inflation, upward movement in inflation. But we think that what the local marketplace was pricing when the peso is 6 pesos to the $1 was when it's inflation rate was in anticipation that the peso would devalue, and that devaluation would go to 8 pesos to $1."

I guess, a general comment on franchisee health is when you operate in as many different combinations of brands and countries as we do, there are always pockets of issues. We've got 2,000 franchisees. There's always going to be some that are having challenges that we're working with. But the vast majority of our franchise system around the world is quite healthy. The areas where we would have more issues that you would expect would be in businesses where we're trying to transform the business a little bit, like Pizza Hut U.S. We're trying to make sure we have the healthiest system of franchisees that we can. Some of the stuff we did in the Transformation Agreement was designed to give us some strength to manage out underperforming franchisees, and you may see some change in the franchise system there. But in general, I think our franchise health around the world is quite good and the unit returns that we're reporting are strong. You heard Yum China yesterday on their earnings call talk about 2-year cash paybacks on brand-new KFCs. So that kind of thing at least to help the franchisees."

With increased rate of mortgage refinancings that we have experienced, we need to take a closer look at our policies and our hedging models. And this has given rise to 2 changes that we have reported in this quarter. One affects the order income, specifically, in Italy and Belgium. And that's in the amount of a negative EUR 127 million of nonrecurring charges, and that mainly has to do with the adjustment of the underlying hedges. The second impact is the one on net interest income. That's basically a change in the recognition of early prepayment fees in the Netherlands, which resulted in a EUR 19 million reversal of net interest income this quarter. But that actually will be spread out over the future, so that is a correction on income, but that is something we will then see coming in, in the future as part of our net interest income line."

As has been discussed, Q2 was a quarter significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the associated governmental shelter in place orders put into effect across the country. While we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic, we believe approximately $23 million to $24 million in FFOM was lost due to situations surrounding the pandemic this quarter. Overall, owned property revenue was $32.4 million, negatively impacted by COVID related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt and waived fees and other items. Somewhat offsetting the lost revenue, owned property operating expenses were $8 million lower than originally budgeted as we were able to reduce spend in each area, except for the uncontrollables of insurance and property taxes. As a result of the lower-than-originally-budgeted property NOI, ground lease expense was approximately $500,000 less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners, and joint venture partners' non-controlling interest and earnings was approximately $1.2 million lower. Additionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1 million lower and FFOM contribution from our on-campus participating properties was also almost $800,000 lower due to universities refunding a portion of spring rents at properties in both of these business segments. Lastly, we were able to create approximately $800,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan for the quarter. ."

It is a company that has a balanced geographic presence that can absorb volatility in individual markets but is also well positioned to participate in opportunities in all growth markets, while at the same time able to maintain healthy and durable EBITDA margin of 40%, including phased synergies. With an attractive dividend yield and enhanced and sustainable cash flow we'll also maintain a solid investment-grade debt profile and a strong balance sheet. As you follow our performance over the next quarter and years, I'm sure you will see in our numbers how we're creating value for our shareholders that is completely different from either company's old neighborhoods of spec pharma and generics or large -- company pharma peers.

This results in an operating margin of 25.7%, which is in line with the one of last year's periods. In Americas, operating profit dropped by 4.4% to $260 million. The operating margins fell to 24.5%. Higher natural gas prices and inflation in some of the countries in South America also had a negative effect on the operating margin."

If you look at what the euro average fourth quarter of last year to this year, you would expect a bit of a headwind. I'm going to say probably $2 million or $3 million just related to translation on the European results. The rest of it is really cross currency exposures. Again, not generally terribly significant, but in the quarter we saw some movements that actually drove it up. I mean, our cross-currency exposures, the South African rand to both the euro and the dollar will have an impact. And as precious metals move, the rand tends to move differently against the euro and the dollar. We do have a bit of exposure between the euro and the yen, because we actually export some ride control product into Japan for vehicles that are manufactured there. Euro and the Eastern European countries will have an impact on us. That was, I think, fairly small in the quarter, but a little bit. And then the Brazilian rial to the U.S. dollar would have just a bit of an impact. So when you combine all those together, that was another roughly $4 million, and that's what makes up the full $7 million impact."

Historically, we included institutional-related costs within the other liability costs line item. We have now moved those institutional costs into our cost of crediting line item. As you can see in our financial supplement, we are now delineating between the cost of crediting on deferred annuities and the cost of crediting on institutional products and other liability costs. Collectively, we will refer to these items as cost of funds. While this change is simply a historical and prospective geographic shift, we believe this change will give the investment community a better framework for analyzing our spread-based business model. To supplement this change, we also are now disclosing an adjusted operating ROA or return on assets measure, which we think will also help analyze our operating earnings in a spread-based context.

And I would say, the second part to that I was alluding to is, is we're starting to get the formula worked out here for how to get more products out on a real time basis, and not just for the U.S., but getting them out globally. And I think to Glenn's point, the Cadence rollout is a good example of that. If you can come up with a new product with the right type of global input, and within an 18-month period, get it out to about 15  to 20 countries, obviously, the ramp-up impact is significantly higher than taking 5 years to do it, U.S. first.

I think on Tamar, what we've talked about is I think we still have, what, 5 to 6 years on that, 5 years from a timing standpoint.

Second, there is a shortage of data scientists and cyber analysts, and security organizations are seeking advanced automation capabilities to perform functions previously performed by humans.

We have made the reservation for the full amount, EUR 300 million, plus taking into account our market share, which is about 10%. So that's the EUR 30 million coming from.

We had also pulled down spends quite a bit because there was unavailability of stock and the country was disrupted.

So even the local competitor is going to be hit with the local currency transaction impact of raw materials coming into the country. So I would say that the incentive to price is fairly elevated across the board."

And as such, we are becoming a favorite partner to other players in the region. We believe that this relationship with IBM will be beneficial for both companies. We've teamed up with IBM on several opportunities in the last year, on both sides of the emerging markets, as a matter of fact. And this announcement is just articulating a process that has been going on for quite some time. We are excited about it. I think that they are excited about it. I know that they are.

Okay? I didn't see the comments that you are referring to, so I can't really comment on those except we know what that process is. And quite frankly, the experience of Superstorm Sandy is one that is fresh in the minds of everybody in the state. So even when there is a hint of, for example, a hurricane, the different protocols are implemented. There has been, and you've seen this in energy master plans, discussion of the importance of distributed generation.  As you would not be surprised to learn, there was a higher level of awareness and interest in that after Superstorm Sandy. That has obviously waned, but my expectation -- now speaking personally -- is that, as we move into 2018 and beyond, you will see more discussion specifically on that point. Inside the company -- and I alluded to this in my comments on CEV -- when we talk about technology and we talk about changes in technology and how that might create additional opportunities for CEV down the road, that's one of the things that we're alluding to."

HFF came with a very strong debt business in the U.K. And if you don't sell at some point in time, you have to refinance, which is very attractive in that interest rate environment at the moment.

Despite minimal market growth and headwinds from the overall environment, APUS experienced 9% growth in net course registrations by students using TA in the year 2011, thereby continuing to increase our market share and cement our position as the leading provider of voluntary education to service members. Even with this growth, active-duty military students represent an increasingly smaller portion of our overall population and growth compared to prior years.

The environment globally is still pretty tough, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're actually doing very well in the environment that we see. But there is still only modest levels of global economic growth I've seen some of the predictions that sort of said globally it might be more like a 3.5 as opposed to a 3. But there's an awful lot of political instability still out there and the lack of clarity in certain countries.

Companies at all levels, even governments, have to address the risk that they face, and we're well positioned to advise them on that.

Germany up 3.5%, driven by rate, Belgium up 5.5% and seeing a strong RevPAR improvement from high occupancy. The only 2 countries there which saw decreases were Netherlands with minus 8%, and that is purely related to a very large congress held last year in August, September with some 30,000 participants in Amsterdam and some weakening a little bit on the airport.  And France, which is slightly negative in terms of RevPAR and that country really continues to suffer economically and is also affected by the legislative tax changes, which have a strong impact on the French market.  Now it's important to note that we see a very positive effect coming here for Rezidor, on the backdrop of the fact that, we exited various leases in France in 2012, and are therefore less effect from the negative performance in this country."

The urgency and imperative to protect people and platforms from proliferated airborne threats has only increased. Today, effective air defense is being achieved through a greater quantity of capable and distributed tactical radars versus the traditional more centralized model. This is similar to what is happening in space with the shift to Low Earth Orbit satellites for missile tracking and detection mission. Our tactical radars are being deployed for a diversity of close-in and short-range air defense applications against drones, missiles and other airborne threats."

So I will comment basically on the gray line, that is basically excluding the exchange rates, where we will see basically the efforts of management and the results of the management of the bank over this quarter. In relation to the first 9 months of 2012, exchange rates explain 2/3 of the fall in gross income and close to half of the decline in net operating income. If we eliminate their impact, gross income declined by 2.9% due to the liquidity buffer, the narrowing of spreads due to the change in the mix toward lower-risk products in some countries, like Brazil, and lower lending volumes. Costs were slightly below or -- the average inflation of the group and low provisions were lower year-on-year. Lastly, the higher attributable profit reflects the impact of large real estate provisions in 2012."

And as student starts, they start at higher rates and that accrues to the revenue per student. A second impact is as military students kind of flatten out in terms of they've been growing over time, as they flattened out as a percentage of our student mix, that discount that they get, you don't get as much of it. So the flattening of that adds to the revenue per student. And the third major bucket of that is in terms of the mix of students and the length of time they stay in school, the electives that they're taking, the manufacturer-specific training that they're taking as well as some of our CTG revenue.

That matters tremendously in the forward outlook. Principally, in the Caribbean, we've been focused, as you know, on reducing our exposure to higher risk markets through divestitures and active derisking measures in the countries that we remain in. Currently, customer assistance programs are showing improvement in portfolio performance with a significant decrease in early delinquency across the region. We've adjusted our risk strategies to reflect changes in the risk profile and this has been followed by an expansion of customer assistance capabilities based on those increased delinquency volumes. Over the coming months, we expect delinquency levels to be changeable, as the economic impact in the region is expected to last through the end of the year, and this is reflected in our provisioning methodology.

New Class 2 and Class 3 models launched in the first half of 2014 are demonstrating significant greater field reliability than prior generation products. Fleet composition is also changing rapidly as a result of our sales growth, and this will have a positive effect on field reliability and labor cost. Today, we have over 5,000 GenDrive units under GenCare service management. A percentage of new models, which represent our most reliable systems, is increasing due to sales growth, while older, early-generation, legacy models are beginning to retire as customers purchase new material handling equipment and refresh their GenDrive fleet. These legacy models represent less reliable systems, coupled with a high replacement part cost due to component and parts obsolescence. Increasing unit volume within a local geographical area also has a positive impact on labor cost, and we are seeing this as more and more sites are being clustered in area.

Regarding the concerns or the potential regulations about local banks potentially not being able to lend outside of their region or region of jurisdiction, it's probably worth pointing out that now as mentioned earlier, we have over 100 institutional funding partners all over the country. We're aware of the potential for such a role, but we also have major national banks who are our funding partners. In addition, we are also in anticipation for any potential changes cultivating relationships with more and more regional banks. So that when and if, and perhaps the emphasis should be on if right now, any new regulations emerge on this front, it will be like other times when new regulations emerge. We should be able to manage it relatively smoothly, if not completely smoothly with limited or even no impact to our underlying business, as has happened in general in the past. So in short, we're prepared. We're prepared for anything that might happen on that front. Now that said, whether the rule will come out or whether there's anything that's being decided or what's the time horizon from that, we haven't heard anything new.

And the only way you can basically substitute China right now is also if you increase activity in Mexico. So we see that as a core strength of the country. Bear in mind that we're also seeing a lot of activity actually of Asian companies coming into the border towns basically installing fixed capacity in those towns and basically trying to bypass those royalties by also leveraging on the -- on Mexican label, which, as you know, is basically less expensive than that of China.

What we need to understand and what the market is starting to understand is that the game, Sports Betting, is bigger than the casino world. So the casino world is limited by location, by branding, by customer base. There are more Sports Betting players in the world than casino players. And globally, where Sports Betting is regulated, it is a wide area game, same as lottery, rather than a destination game like a casino. So you would go to a casino to play poker and roulette, but you need to be able to have access to a bigger game like Sports Betting. And Australia and U.K. and Italy, who are globally the most advanced Sports Betting countries in the world, they have adopted this wide area model. I don't see why U.S. should be different in concept. Now how strong is the casino lobby in Atlantic, in New Jersey, in Nevada and in a couple other states; in New York, very strong; in U.S., very strong.

In addition, we've introduced some new credit scoring, scorecards that better differentiate the market, so it helps on the originations upfront.

This means going back at least the past 30 years. Passenger demand continues to grow at rates well above world GDP growth, and a strong performance is being seen across all the major areas of the world. Rarely do we see such diverse and strong results. For example, recently announced passenger growth in August was 7.2% worldwide as compared to a year ago and no single market shows less than 5% growth. Asia-Pacific, which includes India and is the largest single market, grew at 9%. North America and Europe, which combined total over 50% of the world's market, grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Furthermore, carriers are being prudent in growing their capacity, resulting in load factors reaching all-time highs. Fuel prices remain in check and the capital markets remain very accommodative. As a result, airlines around the world are earning near record profits. Even the recent failures this summer and the continuing threat of renewed geopolitical risk have failed to halt the growth and demand for air travel worldwide."

To get people that are willing to accept or willing to pay, we brought our pricing down. I don't know if I'm able to give you a specific number like 80% of revenue, 90% of revenue because it really -- the trailing revenue to us, in many cases, is not as important as the geographic location and the upside potential of the market that we're looking at.

And with the U.S. position, I'm certain that we are not only strategically but also tactically improved our position in the U.S. We saw a solid organic sales growth driven all -- by all business groups. We saw very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets at 7.8%, which is almost similar to previous years, despite the Russian crisis, despite the war in the Middle East, et cetera.

And you've certainly seen a lot of the operators, the cable companies like Comcast, Time Warner, Rogers, deploying home automation systems, and we're certainly playing very prominent role in those rollouts, both with the retailers and with operators. We've seen a lot of activity recently in the lighting area. We've -- you had the phaseout of incandescent bulbs in general across the U.S. And that is driving additional adoption of LED lighting and then the integration of ZigBee into those bulbs as these home automation-type systems are rolling out, seems to be a very large trend, and so a lot of activity going on there. And then we just talked about the wearables in health and fitness. And I think, again, that is an interesting market as well.

    "text": "Thanks, Joe. I'll spend a few minutes on the current market environment and our outlook before opening it up for questions. We believe companies will continue to seek growth and cost savings through M&A given the low -- the slower GDP growth and deflationary environment. Our M&A dialogue remains healthy, and the desire for interesting ideas and creative solutions for companies is the highest I've witnessed in a while. In fact, I've never been more confident in the strength of our strategy, the quality of our talent and the resonance of our brand and vision as a trusted adviser in corporate boardrooms. However, it's important to note that during the first quarter, we really did witness what amounted to an air pocket in M&A activity across Wall Street. M&A announcements were down significantly given market volatility and the sharp widening of credit spreads in January and February as well as the increased level of government and political risk transactions, as both antitrust and tax authorities became more aggressive in their stance on deals."

We reported $15.7 million revenue from Training and Simulation, about 70% of our overall quarterly revenue, with a solid increase in gross margins and net income. As we discussed last quarter, some continued uncertainty regarding timing of U.S. Military spending continues. Some orders we had anticipated to have already received in the first half have been pushed out somewhat and are now expected in the second half. We, nevertheless, predict a very profitable Simulation division in the full year results."

We saw orders and backlog both up 10% organically in the quarter. For BSD, that is the Building Solutions & Distribution business, sales were up 6% organically. That was driven by strong backlog conversion globally. And also America's fire and security distribution sales, which were partially offset by slower growth in energy and commercial retrofit projects here in the U.S."
