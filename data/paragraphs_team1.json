You had mentioned that when this order comes out, you're hoping that everyone is going to, I don't know, I guess, make changes and not face sanctions at the FCC. So if you look at your existing interconnection situation between the ISPs that you think are not investing enough money, is your expectation that there's something in the document that will specifically require them to do something that would lead to sanctions? Or is it more likely that you would have to file a complaint? And can you just talk about what exactly are you going to put in the complaint if that's the process as opposed to what you described as far as some type of sanction for something which I thought was already a complaint process?"

In the 9 months of 2011, the decline of domestic sales volumes has been dramatic, and coupled with the shutdown of export markets in North Africa, has led capacity utilization of our plants to historically low levels. The decline of sales has come across all products and market segments with across-the-board pricing pressures. In general, the increase in uncertainty regarding the political and the economic prospects of the country are severely affecting demand for building materials both in the private as well as in the public sector. In the private sector, continued sharp reductions in employment, a drop in real disposable income and an elevated tax burden on real estate properties discourage construction decisions. Furthermore, lack of credit availability from banks and a still high outstanding stalk of houses for sale weakened the prospects of residential investment stabilization. However, regarding public works, they recently announced agreement with the EU to lower the share of national contribution in order to access structural funds to 5% from 27% previously, is expected to support the recovery in public investment activity going forward. For Titan, productivity initiatives, reduction of SG&A expenses by 13% and sale of excess carbon emission rights supported operational profitability. Turnover declined by 36% to EUR 210.3 million, while EBITDA reached EUR 42.7 million with EBITDA margin standing at 20.3%."

And while the swap activity resulted in additional interest expense in the quarter, the termination actually resulted in a $30 million cash inflow which is reflected in the financing section in the statement of cash flows. So it was a financial benefit from a cash perspective and GAAP accounting required some additional expense. Excluding these swap-related items to the unique items with respect to interest expense, interest expense was up about $1 million in the quarter versus first quarter a year-ago. The tax rate in the quarter was in the 40 to 45% range excluding the unique items and reflects really a geographic mix issue in the quarter compounded by the low level of earnings both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And it is what it is in the quarter, that reflects our actual experience.

We expect lower commodity costs and currency-related inflationary pressure on governments in many countries will combine to create a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovations.

We are cautiously optimistic about 2017 based on the order entry we are seeing in recent weeks and the fourth quarter growth in select end markets, particularly consumer electronics and industrial components. Also as I mentioned earlier, we believe the oil and gas market has troughed and is poised for modest recovery in 2017. However, there continues to be uncertainty regarding geopolitical events and the U.S. policy with the new presidential administration. The ultimate impact of these events and/or policy changes on the U.S. and global economy is difficult to predict."

Now if I exclude again the incremental impact of political spending, total television revenues are expected to increase in the very high single-digits to perhaps 10%, 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, again reflecting our strong stations, as well as continued good execution on the sales front. But as always, I have to caveat that we are early in the quarter, and as we all know, pacing can be volatile. So stay tuned, and we'll continue to update you as the quarter progresses."

But according to us, the Indian production will be about 34.5 million to 35 million bales. And with the opening stock of 3.6 million bales as on 1st October, 2018 and with the import of 1.5 million bales, consumptions of 32 million bales, export of 4.5 million bales, the total take off will be about 36.5 million bales. Ending stock will be about 3.1 million bales. So there will be a reduction in stock or this is the possible the country may export more cotton. Already [ 22.5 ] million bales have already been exported from the country up to 31st January, 2019. And this 4.5 million bales export we are taking on the very conservative side. If there is a more export, then there will be further reduction in the stock. This is all about the international situation and as far as the Indian cotton situation is concerned. But if we compare the cotton prices, which were prevailing in the month of December, January and February year '17, '18 versus this year and looking to the dollar-rupee relationship at that time with range of $0.63 to $0.64 -- INR 64, in terms of U.S. cents, this year the cotton is competitively cheaper, one.

And during that period, the impact of customer defaults for the last 5 years for AerCap has averaged less than 60 basis points of revenue. That's the net impact. So I am sure we will see customer defaults, but what you have seen in the past time and again from AerCap, is that the collateral package we have, the global reach of our platform has enabled us to come out of these situations with a minimal impact and move the aircraft rapidly to the follow-on lessee.

We view our strong capitalization as a cushion for what is a turbulent region, and we're very happy that we have that. At the same time, that turbulence is what creates opportunity for us. While local players get thrown off by the changing environment in the countries every time that a crisis ensues, and the big financial players, international players, shy away from emerging markets and the region whenever there are these type of uncertainties, Bladex is always there and can spot the opportunities and act accordingly. So having the strong capitalization enables us to both weather the storm or the bad weather, whatever -- in whatever form it comes, and it also allows us to capitalize on the opportunity that is created from a higher-margin, lower-liquidity environment.

From our side, we are making the company far more efficient, far more productive, far more conscious of costs, far more conscious of premiums, far more conscious of the new position which we have taken in the marketplace. And we think that though immediate future may be a little clouded, we don't know how it's going to pan out, just like the way you are having Nisarga right now, little cloudy. But we think that we will be -- we will emerge from this significantly leaner, significantly stronger, significantly improved performance."

The U.S. property and casualty companies within the U.S. tax group, although incurring material underwriting losses due to the catastrophic events discussed previously, had these losses overshadowed by a gains emanating from our U.S. mortgage unit. This put the U.S. tax group in a taxpaying position, even though the company overall sustained operating losses. The underlying effective annual tax rate grew to 19% even for the year for the same basic reason, which is a lower level of estimated full year operating income than was forecast as of last quarter. The increase in the estimated effective annual tax rate causes the first 2 quarters of 2017 to be reevaluated at this now higher rate, and this impact reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. Therefore, this tax adjustment is directly derivative from the catastrophic loss estimates. And as a reminder, our tax rate is affected by varying mixes of income by geographical distribution and any associated changes on local tax rates. As for after-tax operating income earnings per share accretion realized in the third quarter from the UGC acquisition, we examined our results with and without the impact to the acquisition and the accretion remains consistent with past quarters and continues to move towards the initial 35% target."

Excluding the impact of this adjustment, gross profit margin was 34.7%, an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year. The increase in gross margins was driven by a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of lower commodity costs and overseas sourcing benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar in recent quarters, a favorable overall organic product mix, primarily due to a higher sales mix of residential products in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year, and the favorable impact of gross margin from the acquisition of Country Home Products.

International sales continued to decline partly on the back of adverse general economic settings like in Greece and partly on the back of negative currency impact in many countries. The gross profit on sales increased as did the gross profit margin. Operating earnings were up. Working capital strongly improved.

In opening remarks, you said that the performance is strong and you consistently show now profitability of around 30%, both last year and this year.

You referenced political risk, but perhaps you could maybe follow up on that and comment on what would you need to really see for you to be more comfortable to grow in the country?

First, the accelerator mission allows for reciprocal data rights back to UrtheCast, which, in turn, allows for SAR-XL data sales revenues much earlier than would otherwise have been the case and allows for building the customer base for OptiSAR data in advance of the constellation being launched. Secondly, the accelerator mission or missions significantly derisks OptiSAR technologically, financially and programmatically. Thirdly, at this time, UrtheCast's management and board believe that a pushout in the anticipated or target date for OptiSAR is prudent, in large part because that reflects the reality of the situation with the customers and also the reality of implementing a stand-alone SAR program as described. Fourth, the accelerator mission will provide UrtheCast with more time to sign further contracts and to arrange for the necessary export credit and project financing. Fifth, the accelerator mission will send what we think is a very significant signal to prospective OptiSAR customers that the technology and the program are real and that they significantly boost our credibility for being able to execute and deliver on programs of this scale.

But we should see some improvement to our cost structure with 8 pesos to the $1. What we're evaluating is what is that impact on inflation. I don't mean to dominate the answer -- the time with an answer to this question, but Argentina is an important country to discuss, the issues are important to discuss. What we're considering is when we look at an inflation rate in the country at the present level, when we see the currency devalue from 6 pesos to 8 pesos to the $1, is the inflation already baked into an expectation that the currency would go to 8 pesos to the $1 dollar. Our expectation is that over the intermediate and longer term, the answer is yes. There might be some short term movement in inflation, upward movement in inflation. But we think that what the local marketplace was pricing when the peso is 6 pesos to the $1 was when it's inflation rate was in anticipation that the peso would devalue, and that devaluation would go to 8 pesos to $1."

We see a market where compliance requirements continue to increase and where cyber threats continue to evolve and exploit multiple business communication channels. We see a market where companies increasingly leverage the cloud, and their employees do even more work on mobile devices. Whether at social media, mobile, audio, video, e-mail, business customers, both small and large, will require an even more advanced set of tools and solutions to combat security threats and securely retain the communications data necessary to protect their businesses."

Considering the number of identities an enterprise may need to manage, each of which may be accessing a myriad of applications with varying levels of permissions, a typical global enterprise could easily have millions of points of access into their systems. Each of these represents a point of exposure. And if just one access point is breached, it can compromise the entire organization. In addition to this very real security concern, organizations are also wrestling with the growing compliance requirements facing their businesses. And new regulations that focus more on privacy, like the general Data Protection Act, are shining a light on a growing area of risk, data, including private personal information, and sensitive corporate information, including financial reports and intellectual property. SailPoint's vision has always been to manage the digital identities of all users, such as employees, contractors, business partners and even bots and devices across all applications whether running in a data center or in the cloud and all data whether in structured applications or stored in files."

Over the last 14 months, as our larger, more sophisticated customers become more reliant on our deployment delivery model staff aug and viewing it competitively against project consulting and offshoring, they've been deciding to spend more of their annual budgets on staff aug than offshoring, especially with the uncertainty about immigration reform. You got to remember that these bills have been introduced both by the Democratic members of the house as well as the Republicans. And so this is something they can probably agree to. So what we've seen early on is even before there is any change in the law that certain customers are hedging their bets and not being as dependent on newer projects being executed on those deployment models versus domestic deployment models."

The response to that in the market has created an illiquidity in our -- on our position, and we're trying to assess how that effects the stock.

We agree with you that the yield is not reflective of where we think the stock should be or the units -- the price should be.

Just wanted to know if you've seen any sequential decline or flattening in pricing in your D&I and Utilities cables from the level we've seen in Q3, Q4 last year? That's question number one. The question number two is on Brazil. I think last year already in Q1, you had some weak Q1. Just wanted to know if it was that some kind of seasonality that you've seen in Brazil? Or is it just like a some weakening demand in that market and in general? So just remind us the level of possibility of that country for Utilities cables compared to the rest of the division."

As has been discussed, Q2 was a quarter significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the associated governmental shelter in place orders put into effect across the country. While we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic, we believe approximately $23 million to $24 million in FFOM was lost due to situations surrounding the pandemic this quarter. Overall, owned property revenue was $32.4 million, negatively impacted by COVID related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt and waived fees and other items. Somewhat offsetting the lost revenue, owned property operating expenses were $8 million lower than originally budgeted as we were able to reduce spend in each area, except for the uncontrollables of insurance and property taxes. As a result of the lower-than-originally-budgeted property NOI, ground lease expense was approximately $500,000 less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners, and joint venture partners' non-controlling interest and earnings was approximately $1.2 million lower. Additionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1 million lower and FFOM contribution from our on-campus participating properties was also almost $800,000 lower due to universities refunding a portion of spring rents at properties in both of these business segments. Lastly, we were able to create approximately $800,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan for the quarter. ."

The Central Bank of Sudan decided to set its daily currency exchange rate using a newly formed body of bankers and exchange bureaus effective October 7, 2018. This resulted in an official exchange rate being set at SDG 47.5 to $1. The official exchange rate before that was SDG 28 to $1. This has the possibility also of causing hyperinflation in the country. We are looking at this, and we are waiting to see the annual 2018 price index to determine the impact of this in a reasonable certainty."

If you recall last year, we also had some political gridlock that was making some noise in the economy. But when we track the tonnage per day, particularly of freight through the month of October -- and you're correct, last year, we saw a decline in our tonnage per day on a sequential basis in October, we saw the exact same thing occur this year. So it's really hard for us to determine is this a new seasonality, or is it the effect of similar confluence of events around political gridlock that's happen to cause the same impact in our businesses? We don't know the answer to that at this point."

From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that is set to expire on December 9 of this year.

If you look at what the euro average fourth quarter of last year to this year, you would expect a bit of a headwind. I'm going to say probably $2 million or $3 million just related to translation on the European results. The rest of it is really cross currency exposures. Again, not generally terribly significant, but in the quarter we saw some movements that actually drove it up. I mean, our cross-currency exposures, the South African rand to both the euro and the dollar will have an impact. And as precious metals move, the rand tends to move differently against the euro and the dollar. We do have a bit of exposure between the euro and the yen, because we actually export some ride control product into Japan for vehicles that are manufactured there. Euro and the Eastern European countries will have an impact on us. That was, I think, fairly small in the quarter, but a little bit.

While this change is simply a historical and prospective geographic shift, we believe this change will give the investment community a better framework for analyzing our spread-based business model. To supplement this change, we also are now disclosing an adjusted operating ROA or return on assets measure, which we think will also help analyze our operating earnings in a spread-based context. Lastly, to provide even more transparency around the strong credit quality of our asset portfolio, we've included in the financial supplement new information on a credit quality of total invested assets as well as the largest components of our structured securities portfolio."

Tooling sales declined slightly compared to a year ago and had a negative effect of 1% on the top line growth. From a geographic standpoint, our European operations represented approximately 56% of sales this year versus 59% of sales in the prior year, while our U.S. operations accounted for 27% of sales versus 26% last year."

And so that does have a major impact, I wouldn't say it's regulatory. It's recommended through some of the endoscopy associations and sterilization organizations.

And I think what this represents is, when you have a portfolio in ankle that says, you're really the or one of the top 2 or 3 players in that area, and the fact that ankle is probably the fastest subsegment growth within extremities, that's really the combination which is driving it. And I would say, the second part to that I was alluding to is, is we're starting to get the formula worked out here for how to get more products out on a real time basis, and not just for the U.S., but getting them out globally. And I think to Glenn's point, the Cadence rollout is a good example of that. If you can come up with a new product with the right type of global input, and within an 18-month period, get it out to about 15  to 20 countries, obviously, the ramp-up impact is significantly higher than taking 5 years to do it, U.S. first. And that's some of the benefit that we're starting to see. I think on the SSS side, when you look at CUSA Clarity, it's another good example of feedback from markets all around the world, factoring in feature changes, ergonomic needs and then being able to actually launch that product simultaneously around the world, will create greater and faster ramp-ups than we've seen in previous product launches."

But as I said on an earlier comment, I don't know that you should expect what's happened in oil prices recently to have a very near-term effect on the international countries that we operate in."

First, security threats are becoming more complex. As a result, security intelligence organizations find it more difficult to detect, investigate and neutralize threats and are seeking new data mining solutions. Second, there is a shortage of data scientists and cyber analysts, and security organizations are seeking advanced automation capabilities to perform functions previously performed by humans. And third, security organizations are looking for predictive intelligence as a force multiplier. Predictive intelligence is generated by correlating massive amounts of data from a wide range of disparate sources to uncover previously unknown connections, identify suspicious behaviors and predict future events."

Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and Emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related. We believe the majority of the slowdown in the emerging markets has been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrops and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets."

Although the global economy is poised to improve this year, we remain aware and very alert to the potential threats represented by the greater emphasis on protectionism and economic nationalism and the heightened geopolitical risks.

So it's actually lower than our target of 95%. It's early days, first quarter. But we have provisioned EUR 30 million in Belgium for those claims resulting out of the terrorist attacks. And that is quite conservative. Probably, you know that the terrorist attacks in Belgium are settled via a fund, funds for terrorist attacks. And that fund is picking up the first EUR 300 million -- or actually, it's financed, the first EUR 300 million, by the insurance industry. We have made the reservation for the full amount, EUR 300 million, plus taking into account our market share, which is about 10%. So that's the EUR 30 million coming from.

We had also pulled down spends quite a bit because there was unavailability of stock and the country was disrupted.

What we had decided in the last 3 [ph] months is to invest in the security and to use the -- to reduce the risk for our shareholders in terms of floating rates thereby increasing our fixed rate to 60% and so investing in duration in our fixed rate as a duration of 5 years.

First, we issued our inaugural Green bond, raising $500 million of 7 year debt at 2.7%. Welltower's ESG team, led by Kirby Brendsel, put a lot of time and effort in preparing for the reporting requirements that come with Green bond financing and is paid off with tremendous support received from ESG investors. Welltower is committed to staying at the forefront of ESG initiatives and we look forward to growing this part of our capital stack going forward."

And then the other areas of our business is then much, much smaller, especially the equity placement and the loan sales. I mean this is obviously something which is very relevant for us going forward because if I move just quickly to the U.K., in an environment where the owners of buildings in the U.K. are unwilling to kind of lower their price expectations, whereas the buyers have an ambition to kind of get a premium for buying into the U.K. market in that political uncertainty, the transaction volumes in the U.K. have been down very, very significantly. HFF came with a very strong debt business in the U.K. And if you don't sell at some point in time, you have to refinance, which is very attractive in that interest rate environment at the moment. And so that debt business is probably something which will show more growth, not only in the U.S., but also in the U.K. and other areas of the world when volumes on the investment sales side may be slightly muted in a more critical environment."

And the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has dropped another 20 to 30 basis points to around 2.25%. This increased volatility has not had any impact on our operations or leasing activities.

However, the percentage of those courses taken online by those students rose from 71% in 2010 to 75% in 2011, resulting in the slight increase in demand for online courses by military students. Despite minimal market growth and headwinds from the overall environment, APUS experienced 9% growth in net course registrations by students using TA in the year 2011, thereby continuing to increase our market share and cement our position as the leading provider of voluntary education to service members. Even with this growth, active-duty military students represent an increasingly smaller portion of our overall population and growth compared to prior years. Going forward, we believe that a combination of factors may cause military enrollment at AMU to be volatile and possibly decline.

So in unsecured loan, what we see is a drop-down to 30% of what we usually see in unsecured loans. There is some fluctuation. What do we expect is this number will improve in the course of the time when we see somehow a release of these restrictions. This will come, but it takes some time. It's a little bit more difficult country-by-country to understand what is the impact on the secured part. So mortgages difficult to differentiate if there is a backlog from the days before they close down or is it that activities there are significantly higher than in the unsecured loan, but still down from normal times."

So I will comment basically on the gray line, that is basically excluding the exchange rates, where we will see basically the efforts of management and the results of the management of the bank over this quarter. In relation to the first 9 months of 2012, exchange rates explain 2/3 of the fall in gross income and close to half of the decline in net operating income. If we eliminate their impact, gross income declined by 2.9% due to the liquidity buffer, the narrowing of spreads due to the change in the mix toward lower-risk products in some countries, like Brazil, and lower lending volumes. Costs were slightly below or -- the average inflation of the group and low provisions were lower year-on-year. Lastly, the higher attributable profit reflects the impact of large real estate provisions in 2012."

One is normal tuition increases that tend to run 2.5% to 3% and those have been -- as you'll recall, those get booked over time. And as student starts, they start at higher rates and that accrues to the revenue per student. A second impact is as military students kind of flatten out in terms of they've been growing over time, as they flattened out as a percentage of our student mix, that discount that they get, you don't get as much of it. So the flattening of that adds to the revenue per student. And the third major bucket of that is in terms of the mix of students and the length of time they stay in school, the electives that they're taking, the manufacturer-specific training that they're taking as well as some of our CTG revenue.

That matters tremendously in the forward outlook. Principally, in the Caribbean, we've been focused, as you know, on reducing our exposure to higher risk markets through divestitures and active derisking measures in the countries that we remain in. Currently, customer assistance programs are showing improvement in portfolio performance with a significant decrease in early delinquency across the region. We've adjusted our risk strategies to reflect changes in the risk profile and this has been followed by an expansion of customer assistance capabilities based on those increased delinquency volumes. Over the coming months, we expect delinquency levels to be changeable, as the economic impact in the region is expected to last through the end of the year, and this is reflected in our provisioning methodology. But I'd say overall, Nacho (sic) [ Doug ] that we are pleased that our recent divestitures in Central American and Caribbean are complete, and this results in a better risk profile for the region."

New Class 2 and Class 3 models launched in the first half of 2014 are demonstrating significant greater field reliability than prior generation products. Fleet composition is also changing rapidly as a result of our sales growth, and this will have a positive effect on field reliability and labor cost. Today, we have over 5,000 GenDrive units under GenCare service management. A percentage of new models, which represent our most reliable systems, is increasing due to sales growth, while older, early-generation, legacy models are beginning to retire as customers purchase new material handling equipment and refresh their GenDrive fleet. These legacy models represent less reliable systems, coupled with a high replacement part cost due to component and parts obsolescence. Increasing unit volume within a local geographical area also has a positive impact on labor cost, and we are seeing this as more and more sites are being clustered in area. We expect all of these factors to allow our service operating margins to be breakeven by the end of 2015."

So that we're not reliant on any single funding partner. So hence, as a result of that, there's definitely a lack of concentration among our funding sources and funding partners. Regarding the concerns or the potential regulations about local banks potentially not being able to lend outside of their region or region of jurisdiction, it's probably worth pointing out that now as mentioned earlier, we have over 100 institutional funding partners all over the country. We're aware of the potential for such a role, but we also have major national banks who are our funding partners. In addition, we are also in anticipation for any potential changes cultivating relationships with more and more regional banks. So that when and if, and perhaps the emphasis should be on if right now, any new regulations emerge on this front, it will be like other times when new regulations emerge. We should be able to manage it relatively smoothly, if not completely smoothly with limited or even no impact to our underlying business, as has happened in general in the past. So in short, we're prepared. We're prepared for anything that might happen on that front. Now that said, whether the rule will come out or whether there's anything that's being decided or what's the time horizon from that, we haven't heard anything new.

Given where the conflict between the U.S. and China is in commercial terms, there is -- our view is that the U.S. definitely needs Mexico if it wants to remain competitive in its own manufacturing. And the only way you can basically substitute China right now is also if you increase activity in Mexico. So we see that as a core strength of the country. Bear in mind that we're also seeing a lot of activity actually of Asian companies coming into the border towns basically installing fixed capacity in those towns and basically trying to bypass those royalties by also leveraging on the -- on Mexican label, which, as you know, is basically less expensive than that of China. So -- and then on the -- I would say on the headline side of things, what we're basically seeing is also a little bit more a return to pragmatism by the current administration.

We have made a lot of improvements in managing this business.

However, there's also something to look at the macro environment in South Africa, which has not been helping. There has been a negative growth and there is a negative sentiment in the country.

What we need to understand, meaning that, what is the regulation per state around casinos and VLTs, and each state has a current reality on this. What we need to understand and what the market is starting to understand is that the game, Sports Betting, is bigger than the casino world. So the casino world is limited by location, by branding, by customer base. There are more Sports Betting players in the world than casino players. And globally, where Sports Betting is regulated, it is a wide area game, same as lottery, rather than a destination game like a casino. So you would go to a casino to play poker and roulette, but you need to be able to have access to a bigger game like Sports Betting. And Australia and U.K. and Italy, who are globally the most advanced Sports Betting countries in the world, they have adopted this wide area model. I don't see why U.S. should be different in concept. Now how strong is the casino lobby in Atlantic, in New Jersey, in Nevada and in a couple other states; in New York, very strong; in U.S., very strong.

Sometimes, you might have a situation that a geopolitical event or some economic issue that might be regional or a major move in certain commodities might pull that back.

This means going back at least the past 30 years. Passenger demand continues to grow at rates well above world GDP growth, and a strong performance is being seen across all the major areas of the world. Rarely do we see such diverse and strong results. For example, recently announced passenger growth in August was 7.2% worldwide as compared to a year ago and no single market shows less than 5% growth. Asia-Pacific, which includes India and is the largest single market, grew at 9%. North America and Europe, which combined total over 50% of the world's market, grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Furthermore, carriers are being prudent in growing their capacity, resulting in load factors reaching all-time highs. Fuel prices remain in check and the capital markets remain very accommodative. As a result, airlines around the world are earning near record profits. Even the recent failures this summer and the continuing threat of renewed geopolitical risk have failed to halt the growth and demand for air travel worldwide."

To get people that are willing to accept or willing to pay, we brought our pricing down. I don't know if I'm able to give you a specific number like 80% of revenue, 90% of revenue because it really -- the trailing revenue to us, in many cases, is not as important as the geographic location and the upside potential of the market that we're looking at.

We've seen a lot of activity recently in the lighting area. We've -- you had the phaseout of incandescent bulbs in general across the U.S. And that is driving additional adoption of LED lighting and then the integration of ZigBee into those bulbs as these home automation-type systems are rolling out, seems to be a very large trend, and so a lot of activity going on there.

How long is it going to be?
