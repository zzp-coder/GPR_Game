      <p>
        In this game, you and your partner will read one paragraph at a time and <strong>label each sentence</strong> as either related to geopolitical risk (GPR) or not.
        You’ll earn points for a paragraph only if <strong>all your sentence-level labels exactly match</strong> your partner’s.
        But don’t worry — you and your partner have <strong>up to three attempts</strong> to get it right for each paragraph!
      </p>

      <p>💡 <strong>Important:</strong> Each sentence you select will be labeled as <code>1</code> (GPR-related). Sentences not selected will be labeled as <code>0</code> (not GPR-related).</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🌍 What is a Geopolitical Risk (GPR)?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> refers to the <strong>threat, realization, or escalation</strong> of adverse events related to <strong>wars</strong> or <strong>terrorism</strong> that affect international relations or global business.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Highlight sentences that clearly describe or imply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>War-related events</strong>: e.g., invasion, armed conflict, military strikes. <em>(Note: Trade wars should not be considered war-related events.)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Terrorism</strong>: e.g., political violence, bombings, attacks causing instability</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notification is-info is-light">
        ✅ A sentence can count as GPR even if it doesn’t name a specific country — as long as it reflects political risks affecting international peace, security, or business.

      <h2 class="subtitle">📖 Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Each group (consisting of two members) will annotate <strong>15,000 paragraphs</strong>, one paragraph at a time.</li>
        <li>Each group will also review <strong>disagreement cases</strong> that another team failed to match.</li>
        <li>Each paragraph contains multiple sentences.</li>
        <li>You must label <strong>each sentence individually</strong>, not the paragraph as a whole.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="subtitle">💰 Scoring & Compensation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>You will earn points only if <strong>you and your partner assign the same label to every sentence</strong> in a paragraph.</li>
        <li>In other words, <strong>a perfect match</strong> across all sentences in a paragraph counts as one successful match.</li>
        <li>Points for each successful match are divided between partners based on relative completion time — the faster you finish, the more points you earn.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus points</strong> are awarded for every <strong>100</strong> and <strong>1,000</strong> tasks you complete.</li>
        <li>Any paragraph in which you and your partner fail to agree on every sentence label will be forwarded to another team for review.</li>
        <li>⚠️ Mismatches not only cost your team points but also create scoring opportunities for other teams.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Scoring Example:</strong> If Bob finishes labeling in 10 seconds and Alice in 20 seconds, Bob receives 2/3 of the point while Alice receives 1/3, based on the inverse of their annotation times.</p>

      <p><strong>Compensation Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>💼 <strong>£400 base pay</strong> per annotator who completes all tasks</li>
        <li>🎁 <strong>£800 bonus</strong> shared among the 4 players based on points</li>
        <li>Example: If player scores are split 30%, 25%, 25%, and 20%, then their bonuses would be £240, £200, £200, and £160 respectively</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🎯 Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ To earn points, you and your partner must assign <strong>identical labels</strong> to <strong>every sentence</strong> in the paragraph.</li>
        <li>🔁 You have up to <strong>3 attempts</strong> per paragraph to reach a match.</li>
        <li>⚡ The faster you agree, the higher your score!</li>
      </ul>
