      <h2 class="subtitle">üåç What is a Geopolitical Risk (GPR)?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> refers to the <strong>threat, realization, or escalation</strong> of adverse events related to <strong>wars</strong> or <strong>terrorism</strong> that affect international relations.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Only highlight sentences that clearly describe or imply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>War-related events</strong>: e.g., invasion, armed conflict, military strikes</li>
        <li><strong>Terrorism</strong>: e.g., political violence, bombings, attacks causing instability</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notification is-info is-light">

      <h2 class="subtitle">üîÑ GPR Events and Stages</h2>
      <p>GPR sentences may describe different stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Threat</strong>: Early warnings or risks that war or terrorism may happen</li>
        <li><strong>Realization</strong>: Actual war/attack has occurred</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation</strong>: Worsening or spread of ongoing conflict</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>GPR = Event Type (War / Terrorism) + Stage (Threat / Realization / Escalation)</strong></p>
