      <p>
        In this game, you and your partner will read a paragraph and <strong>select sentences that express geopolitical risks (GPR)</strong>.
        The goal is to agree on which sentences reflect such risks. You earn points by making matching selections!
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🌍 What is a Geopolitical Risk (GPR)?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> refers to the <strong>threat, realization, or escalation</strong> of adverse events related to <strong>wars</strong>, <strong>terrorism</strong>, or tensions that affect international relations.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Highlight sentences that clearly describe or imply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>War-related events</strong>: e.g., invasion, armed conflict, military strikes</li>
        <li><strong>Terrorism</strong>: e.g., political violence, bombings, attacks causing instability</li>
        <li><strong>General Geopolitical Risk</strong>: indirect or broad references to political instability that affect cross-border activities, operations, or international relations</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notification is-info is-light">
        ✅ A sentence can still count as GPR even without naming a specific country or incident—<strong>as long as it refers to meaningful political risk affecting international peace or business</strong>.

      <h2 class="subtitle">✅ Positive Examples</h2>

      <p><strong>WAR:</strong></p>

        </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>TERRORISM:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
          "Quarterly results were negatively impacted by political instability and terrorism in Turkey, Belgium, and France..."
        </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>GENERAL GEOPOLITICAL RISK:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>

          "We are currently navigating significant geopolitical headwinds, which are impacting both our overseas operations and investment outlook in several emerging markets."
        </em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This sentence mentions general instability affecting international operations—<strong>even without a specific war or attack</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">💰 Scoring & Compensation</h2>
      <p>Each group of two players will annotate <strong>15,000 paragraphs</strong> and paragraphs with disagreement from another team. To ensure fairness and reward effort:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>✔️ You only earn points when you and your partner successfully match selections on a paragraph.</li>
        <li>✔️ Your score depends on <strong>how fast you confirm your selections</strong> relative to your partner.</li>
        <li>✔️ Points are <strong>divided between partners</strong> based on who was faster.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Final pay structure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>💼 <strong>£450 base pay</strong> for each annotator who completes all tasks</li>
          <li>🎁 <strong>£700 bonus</strong> shared among all four players based on total points</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Example: Suppose the four players earn points in proportions 30%, 25%, 25%, and 20% respectively. Then their bonuses would be £210, £175, £175, and £140.
        Total pay would be their base £450 plus the bonus, e.g. £660, £625, £625, and £590.
