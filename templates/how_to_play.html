      <p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🌍 What is a Geopolitical Risk (GPR)?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> refers to the <strong>threat, realization, or escalation</strong> of adverse events related to <strong>wars</strong>, <strong>terrorism</strong>, or tensions that affect international relations.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Highlight sentences that clearly describe or imply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>War-related events</strong>: e.g., invasion, armed conflict, military strikes</li>
        <li><strong>Terrorism</strong>: e.g., political violence, bombings, attacks causing instability</li>
        <li><strong>General Geopolitical Risk</strong>: indirect or broad references to political instability that affect cross-border activities, operations, or international relations</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notification is-info is-light">
        ✅ A sentence can still count as GPR even without naming a specific country or incident—<strong>as long as it refers to meaningful political risk affecting international peace or business</strong>.
