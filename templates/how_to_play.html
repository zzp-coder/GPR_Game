      <p>
        In this game, you and your partner will read a paragraph and <strong>label each sentence</strong> as either related to geopolitical risk (GPR) or not.
        You only earn points when <strong>your sentence-level labels match exactly</strong> with your partner!
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🌍 What is a Geopolitical Risk (GPR)?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Geopolitical risk</strong> refers to the <strong>threat, realization, or escalation</strong> of adverse events related to <strong>wars</strong> or <strong>terrorism</strong> that affect international relations or global business.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Highlight sentences that clearly describe or imply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>War-related events</strong>: e.g., invasion, armed conflict, military strikes</li>
        <li><strong>Terrorism</strong>: e.g., political violence, bombings, attacks causing instability</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notification is-info is-light">
        ✅ A sentence can count as GPR even if it doesn’t name a specific country—as long as it reflects political risks affecting international peace, security, or business.
      </div>

      <p>💡 <strong>Important:</strong> Each sentence you select will be labeled as <code>1</code> (GPR-related). Sentences not selected will be labeled as <code>0</code> (not GPR-related).</p>

      <p><strong>WAR:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
          "This core revenue takes into account the recovery phasing in China as well as a $35 million or 55 basis point headwind due to the conflict in Ukraine."
        </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>TERRORISM:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
          "Quarterly results were negatively impacted by political instability and terrorism in Turkey, Belgium, and France..."
        </em>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>GENERAL GEOPOLITICAL RISK:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>
          "We are currently navigating significant geopolitical headwinds, which are impacting both our overseas operations and investment outlook in several emerging markets."
        </em>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🎯 Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You and your partner must select the <strong>same labels for every sentence</strong> in a paragraph to earn points.</li>
        <li>You have <strong>3 attempts per paragraph</strong> to match.</li>
        <li>Faster agreement = higher score!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">💰 Scoring & Compensation</h2>
      <p>Each group of two players will annotate <strong>15,000 paragraphs</strong> and review <strong>disagreement cases</strong> from another team.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>✔️ Suppose <strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> are paired together as one team.</li>
        <li>✔️ You only earn points when <strong>you and your partner give the same label to every sentence in a paragraph</strong>.</li>
        <li>✔️ This means: matching on <strong>every sentence</strong> = 1 successful match.</li>
        <li>✔️ Points are divided based on <strong>who finishes faster</strong>.</li>
        <li>✔️ Extra Points are given when you finish every 100 and 1000 tasks.</li>
        <li>⚠️ Any paragraph where you and your partner <strong>fail to match</strong> will be transferred to another team for review.</li>
        <li>❗ So mismatches not only cost your team points, but also provide scoring opportunities to another team.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Scoring Example:</strong> If Bob finishes labeling a paragraph in 10 seconds and Alice in 20 seconds, Bob gets 2/3 of the point, Alice gets 1/3.</p>

      <p><strong>Final pay structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>💼 <strong>£400 base pay</strong> for each annotator who completes all tasks</li>
        <li>🎁 <strong>£900 bonus</strong> shared among all four players based on total points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example: Suppose the four players earn points in proportions 30%, 25%, 25%, and 20%. Their bonuses would be £270, £225, £225, and £180.
        Total pay = base £400 + bonus = £670, £625, £625, and £580.
