      <p>
        In this game, you and your partner will annotate sentences that express <strong>geopolitical risks</strong> (GPR).
        Your goal is to <strong>agree on which sentences to select</strong> from a paragraph.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">🔧 Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on sentences you believe contain geopolitical risk signals.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>“✅ Confirm Selection”</strong> when you're done.</li>
        <li>You'll be matched with your partner's selections.</li>
        <li>If your selections match, you both get points!</li>
        <li>You have <strong>up to 3 attempts</strong> per paragraph to reach agreement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">💡 Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only match on <strong>substantive risks</strong> — avoid highlighting trivial or unrelated sentences.</li>
        <li>Be thoughtful: longer sentences or vague expressions may not count.</li>
        <li>Speed matters: quicker agreement means higher score!</li>
      </ul>
